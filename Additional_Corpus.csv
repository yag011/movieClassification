"It’s been a long time coming, but Disney magic is back! The glorious fantasy of storytelling, the beauty of fairy tales filled with princes and princesses, magic, wonder, beauty and eye-popping ultra widescreen Technicolor, this is just what we have from Walt Disney Animation Studios with FROZEN; ethereal, beautiful, perfect use of 3D and all to glorious magical effect creating a winter wonderland that sparkles as far as the eye and heart can see.  The epitome of wide-eyed wonder and amazement as exhilarating as seeing your first snowflake, FROZEN will have a smile on your face and your heart, twirling you into a flurry of magical delight.  FROZEN is timeless classic Disney animation in every sense of the word – and pure Oscar gold.

Loosely based on “The Snow Queen” by Hans Christian Anderson, FROZEN is a tale as old as time, and one that Walt Disney himself wanted to bring to life on the big screen but was never able to do.  Enter screenwriter and director Jennifer Lee (the first female director in Disney Animation feature history) who, along with co-director Chris Buck, found a way to honor the tradition of the 1845 fairy tale, develop and contemporize core themes of love and family and the driving force of love versus fear, while presenting engaging and entertaining characters in a beauteous and lush animated setting punctuated with signature song.We first meet sisters Anna and Elsa as very young girls.  Members of the Norwegian royal family, Elsa has the power to create snow and ice with the wave of her hand, a little bit of magic that the girls use to heartwarming delight whenever Anna wants to build a snowman or play in the snow – in the great hall dining room.  But when Anna is injured by Elsa’s powers, the King and Queen must call on the mountain trolls to save her from “freezing” – and make her forget, forcing Elsa to now hide her power.  Always afraid that she might hurt Anna again, Elsa spends the next 10 years avoiding her at all costs, imprisoning herself in her own room, with her powers growing and her own heart becoming ice. Even the gates of the kingdom of Arendelle are locked and no one is permitted in or out.  Sadly, the King and Queen are tragically killed, forcing Elsa to assume the crown.

Where Elsa fears the coronation and an inability to hide her now formidable powers, Anna is ebullient.  As the gates of Arendelle open for the occasion, so does Anna’s heart with the meeting of Prince Hans.  But Elsa, trying to control her powers and rein in Anna, gets caught in her own cross-fire, exposing her powers, freezing the kingdom and fleeing high into the mountains determined to never hurt anyone else ever again.  With Arendelle frozen solid and coronation guests unable to leave, there is only one solution.  Someone must find Elsa and bring her back to undo the magic.  And Anna appoints herself as the person to do it.  Joining forces with Anna, she meets Kristoff and his reindeer Sven along with some other interesting creatures along the way, including Olaf, a bouncy little snowman from Anna and Elsa’s youth, an abominable iceman (named Marshmallow of all things) and ultimately Elsa, sitting high atop a mountain in her ice castle.  Can Anna save Elsa?  And what of Arendelle?  And what about Prince Hans? And Kristoff?  Suffice to say, we’ve got more than a few snow moguls to manage along with some hard hitting story snowballs. Where Lee excels with story is by never making Elsa the villain.  Elsa is instead empowered and emboldened once accepting her powers, while we are continually reminded of the love and lightness of the fun she and Anna experienced at her hand as children.  Female driven with confidence and positivity, Elsa and Anna are like two sides of a coin, both strong, albeit one through power and confidence and the other through clumsy sticktuitiveness and love, and through it all Lee maintains a timeless classicism that we all hold dear.  As comes as no surprise, supporting characters are a delight and none moreso than snowman Olaf and reindeer Sven! With strong voicing led by Kristen Bell, who fulfills a life long dream to voice an animated Disney film and now does so as Anna (and K-Bell does her own singing, too!), joining her are Idina Menzel as Elsa, Jonathan Groff as Kristoff, Josh Gad as the warm-hug liking snowman Olaf, Alan Tudyk (quickly becoming a Disney fave) as the Duke of Weselton (often pronounced in jest by all as “Weasel-town”), Ciarin Hinds as Pabbie the rock troll and young actresses Livvy Stubenrauch and Eva Bella as young Anna and Elsa, respectively.

When it comes to animation, the word is WONDROUS!  Calling on a team of more than 60 animators led by Lino DiSalvo, great attention was paid not only to the ambient background animation but creation of the characters, elevating the level of subtleties in individual design through facial rigging and even breathing exercises so as to add more dimension, character and “soul” to each with eyes, sighs, shoulder slumps, gesture. And when it came to animating Sven, animators looked no further than the reindeer who came to visit and provide their natural talents as inspiration.   And of course, there’s snow and ice and snowflakes!  Just as every six-sided snowflake is unique in nature, so they are in FROZEN, as is the use of snow as an emotional tool depending on the type of snow, depth, fury, softness.  And then there’s Elsa’s ice palace!  As if the world of FROZEN isn’t magical enough, your eyes will go wider still at its glistening crystaline beauty. Musically this is the most complex score and individual song components that I have ever heard in a Disney film.   With songs written by husband & wife team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, each song is as unforgettable as the last and none more so than “For the First Time in Forever” – a duet by Bell and Menzel that soars – and “Let It Go!”  Must buy soundtrack now! (In stores November 25th.)

Sparkling with wonder, FROZEN is magical.  Won’t Oscar gold look beautiful glistening in Elsa’s ice palace!

"In Disney’s Moana (2016), a precocious young daughter of a Polynesian chief takes it upon herself to travel out into the ocean to save her people. Legend has it that centuries earlier, a powerful demigod stole a magical stone known as the Heart of Te Fiti from its rightful island home. Te Fiti is the name of the island and the goddess of the Earth who breathes life into all things. Without the Heart, death and decay has slowly made its way through the ocean, with the young woman’s home as its next target. The only way to restore the balance of life is to travel out into unknown waters and convince the demigod to return the Heart back to its rightful place.
What the writer (Jared Bush) and directors (Ron Clements/Don Hall/John Musker/Chris Williams) do very well in Disney’s latest animated adventure is incorporate a strong sense of culture and mythology. They allow Polynesian legends and traditions to seep into every detail. There’s weight and importance in how every character moves, speaks, and looks. This is the first time where we see animated characters in full body tattoos, each one significant to that person’s life. But while this is geared from a specific people, it isn’t so far detached for general audiences that the themes become lost in translation. Like many stories about a hero/heroine, this is very much about a character having the courage to step out of their comfort zone to see how far they can go.
Moana (Auli’i Cravalho) exhibits these traits from the beginning. Unlike other children her age, she doesn’t shy away from scary stories about the world outside of her little island. She longs to go out and explore – she has the heart of an adventurer, despite the protests of her chief father Tui (Temuera Morrison). When her island of Motunui no longer is able to harvest edible food, Moana does what she feels is right: taking a small canoe and traveling beyond the reef to find the demigod Maui, the one responsible for stealing the Heart of Te Fiti.
As a character, Moana exhibits the usual traits we would see in a protagonist. She’s determined but unsure, she knows what her goal is but doesn’t know how to reach it. Like most young people, she has grand ideas but not the maturity to see the process. Foolishly, she sets off on her adventure without being an experienced sailor. Most of her experience is done through trial and error. This is where she’s most interesting, trying to work things out and stumbling along the way. One of her more endearing traits is the way she practices what she’s going to say when she meets Maui, and how she’s going to convince him to team up with her. Heroes are bland when they’re simply heroic; it’s when they have doubts and fears that make them more relatable, more human. Moana is that without question.
Maui (Dwayne Johnson) might be an even better character. With his large body, wide face, long hair, and a body completely covered in tattoos, Maui is a person we’ve never seen from Disney before. He’s brash and egocentric, completely willing to taut his great victories and contributions to the world. With his magical hook, Maui can transform into different animals, most preferably a powerful hawk. It’s his narcissism that makes him unique. At first, Maui has no interest in helping Moana. In fact, he goes so far as to leave her for dead at certain points (the narrative works around this by making the ocean a living, breathing thing, tossing Moana back on to the canoe whenever she falls in). Maui has the largest emotional arc, as Moana slowly chips away at him to find his compassionate side. The two make a nice tag team whether they are foils or friends, and the voice work by Cravalho and Johnson provide plenty of energy.
The animation and character design are yet another noteworthy accomplishment. Pixar better take notice: Disney Animation Studios may not have surpassed them in terms of sustained success, but they have come close (if not equal) to recent stand out quality. From the island environments, to the movement of the water, even Moana and Maui’s hair have a tangible authenticity. One clever bit is Maui’s tattoos, and how it shifts and changes with every adventure he undertakes. The tattoos are alive, acting as a companion instead of decorations. How strange, that something that was considered taboo decades ago have become so familiar and accepted that it can now be a featured element in a family friendly picture.
The music stands out as a contrast between some of the best Disney has produced in awhile to some of its most forgettable. Maui’s main theme “You’re Welcome” is a reflection of his vanity. While it’s fun and Dwayne Johnson tries his best to give some flair in his singing, it doesn’t really stick very well. Even worse is Jemaine Clement’s “Shiny.” As a villain’s song, it stands out badly from the rest, as though it belongs in another movie. In fact, the entire scene it’s featured in (where Moana and Maui battle a giant crab) just felt out of place and awkward. However, the production made up for these missteps with the central piece “How Far I’ll Go” about having the strength to follow one’s true calling. It’s an appropriate message for Moana, and is repeated throughout. “We Know The Way,” performed by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Opetaia Foa’i, is emotionally stirring with its rhythmic drumming and melodic chanting, and should have been the central song. It’s comparable to “Circle of Life” from The Lion King (1994), it’s that good. The fact that it’s so short (barely two and half minutes) and comes in the second act proves to be a missed opportunity to make this one of Disney’s classic songs.
Moana is bright and colorful. It never drags (even through some of the less than stellar songs), and it opens us up to a familiar story through folklore that hasn’t been seen on screen that often. People can poke fun at the “Disney Machine” all they want, but when they’re on their game they’re on their game.

"There are films that simply know how to make an audience happy, and there are those that shamelessly manipulate a crowd into trying to feel something to the point of exhaustion. Thankfully, Hidden Figures falls into the former category with impressive results with of a superb cast and a true-life story long overdue in the telling. The story is set at the height of the space race between the United States and Russia, a race that Russia appeared to be winning. But unbeknownst to most, a team of African-American women working in the bowels of NASA acting as human calculators were critical to the program of putting the first man in orbit.

Directed by Theodore Melfi (St. Vincent), Hidden Figures narrows its focus on three best friends who drive to work together every morning—Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe, also doing fantastic work in Moonlight) each had special technical and mathematical skills that were largely untapped in this work. Thankfully, NASA was so desperate and behind on the Soviets work that they were willing push past racial and gender biases in an effort to find the people that would push them ahead in the race to the stars, with Johnson being the real star of the show as she moved into the eye of the storm that determined exactly how their astronauts would re-enter the atmosphere without burning up.

The film is peppered with various examples of racism perpetrated by their co-workers, especially Johnson who had to run nearly a mile to another building to use the building’s only restroom for colored women, causing her to disappear from her desk for long stretches. When her boss, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) finds this out, he immediately desegregates all of the bathrooms at NASA—one small step for racial equality. Others at NASA aren’t as happy having black women make them look less intelligent, including another of Johnson’s co-workers (Jim Parsons), who gets particularly nasty with her, as well as the woman in charge of human resources (Kirsten Dunst), who never feels any of the black women would work well in the rest of the organization. But their inherent smarts and desire to move up in NASA seem to win every time over such short sightedness.

While Johnson continually finds ways to impress those around her with her work, Vaughan secretly learns how to use the new IBM machines being brought into NASA that will eventually make her team obsolete. She then teaches her group how to code these daunting machines, and when IBM is finally ready to integrate the machines into NASA calculation processes, Vaughan and her women are the only ones who know how to use the equipment. All the while, Jackson is breaking a few barriers of her own to get a degree and become an engineer at NASA with the help of the local court system.
The importance of their place in NASA was never more clear than when John Glenn (Glen Powell), the man who would pilot the first orbit of earth, put a great deal of faith in Johnson before taking off and made sure she was as important to his mission as anyone else. I first saw Hidden Figures just a couple of weeks before Glenn’s recent passing, and the film’s depiction of him as a truly good, talented and kind man is a fitting and lovely tribute.
All three of the leads, as well as Costner (who has played this type of role before quite effectively in films like JFK and Thirteen Days) are quite good here, but it’s Henson that walks away with Hidden Figures. She’s a genuine math nerd—quiet and shy about everything except how good she is at calculating. We sometimes see her at home with her husband (Mahershala Ali, also from Moonlight), who is a bit miffed at how buried his wife is in her work but understands that what she’s accomplishing is important. The pressures on Katherine are almost impossible to imagine, both at home (she also had three children) and at work, but Henson captures her tireless spirit, intelligence and desire to both stand out and not stick out. More than anything, all the women in the group bring a sense of pride to their work that many of their career-driven counterparts simply don’t possess to the same degree.
Hidden Figures may feel somewhat watered down at times, to the point where it begins to resemble a Civil Rights 101 lesson, but it’s an easy flaw to overlook because the movie doesn’t skimp on the math and technical jargon, which is impenetrable at times, but we still get a sense of what is being discussed and who among the team is doing it right. Adapted by Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi from the book by Margot Lee Shetterly, the film takes its audience into the corridors where geniuses dare to walk, and where ultimately, the quality of the work is what matters most. This is an inspirational tale that should have been told decades ago, but it’s encouraging that it’s being told at all.

"The world can seem a very different place depending on the window you’re looking out of. Out of their stinkbug and mildew-infested basement apartment, the Kim family sees steel bars. Beyond that, one of Seoul’s backstreets – the kind that drunks dive into to relieve themselves. When the street fumigators go by, they leave their windows open so their apartment can be treated for free, even if they nearly choke to death in the process. Then there’s the Park family, settled in a quiet suburban home that’s halfway between an art installation and a fortress. Half the walls are made of glass, offering a clear view of the acid-green lawn outside and the vegetation that encloses it on all sides. It’s a vista of immense serenity, safety, and eerie perfection.
The Park patriarch Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun) is a tech CEO who’s barely home, while his wife Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong) is fluttery and fragile. She obsesses over the imagined artistic genius of her son. He specialises in angry, rebellious scribbles. Toy dogs keep appearing out of nowhere. Are they multiplying in secret?
It’s into this shiny, hollow world that the Kim family try to integrate themselves, after the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is hired as an English-language tutor. He immediately hatches a plan to get the rest of the clan – which comprises his parents, Ki-taek (veteran actor Song Kang-ho) and Chung-sook (Chang Hyae Jin), as well as his sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) – employed. Their schemes are exhilarating, as clever and intricately plotted as they are mildly preposterous. For much of Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite, which the director co-wrote with Han Jin-won, the audience is swept up in the heady thrill of the con. We see them forge documents, invent aliases, and carefully rehearse their lines.
But Bong has never made a straightforward film in his life – that’s why he’s one of the great masters of the cinematic game (his awards recognition is long overdue, with Parasite landing six Oscar nominations). The director’s work is as playful as it is sincere and revelatory. He’ll make you feel at home, and then rip the rug out from under you. As his takes on the monster movie (2006’s The Host) and dystopian fantasy (2013’s Snowpiercer) already proved, the director has an affinity for genre cinema, but has never felt confined by its rules. Parasite doesn’t quite take place in our world, but neither is it fantasy. It happens in a world that would exist if people’s desires and motivations weren’t stuffed below the surface.
The director’s always shown an interest in class conflict. The train in Snowpiercer is just one big metaphor for capitalism, after all. But Parasite might be his most intricate examination of the topic so far. The “parasite” of the title applies to every character in this film; the rich leech off the poor, who in turn survive by attaching themselves to the underbelly of the ruling class.
Everyone’s fixated on transforming into something else: the Kim family give themselves new backstories that involve fancy foreign colleges and elite skill sets. Yeon-gyo is obsessed with American culture (the most capitalist of them all), importing Native American-style toys for her son and declaring he’s the next Basquiat. In Parasite, capitalism is an illusion piled onto another illusion, with everyone trampling each other to reach some undefined goal.
Much of this story, however, isn’t told in words, but in the use of space and the way people move through it. The Kim family are often bundled into the same frame, perched awkwardly on furniture and fittings so they can all fit. They’re a united front in this battle. The Park family, meanwhile, always sit in separate rooms or sides of the frame. No wonder they’re so weak and easily manipulated.
But, be warned: there are no victories in Parasite. And no one gets away scot-free.
