0,JC_Doc1_AI-Artificial-Intelligence.docx,"Greatness and miscalculation fight for screen space in Steven Spielberg's ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence,"" a movie both wonderful and maddening. Here is one of the most ambitious films of recent years, filled with wondrous sights and provocative ideas, but it miscalculates in asking us to invest our emotions in a character that is, after all, a machine.

""What responsibility does a human have to a robot that genuinely loves?"" the film asks, and the answer is: none. Because the robot does not genuinely love. It genuinely only seems to love. We are expert at projecting human emotions into non-human subjects, from animals to clouds to computer games, but the emotions reside only in our minds. ""A.I."" evades its responsibility to deal rigorously with this trait and goes for an ending that wants us to cry, but had me asking questions just when I should have been finding answers.

At the center of the movie is an idea from Brian Aldiss' 1969 short story, ""Supertoys Last All Summer Long,"" about an advanced cybernetic pet that is abandoned in the woods. When real household animals are abandoned, there is the sense that humans have broken their compact with them. But when a manufactured pet is thrown away, is that really any different from junking a computer? (I hope Buzz Lightyear is not reading these words.) From a coldly logical point of view, should we think of David, the cute young hero of ""A.I.,"" as more than a very advanced gigapet? Do our human feelings for him make him human? Stanley Kubrick worked on this material for 15 years, before passing it on to Spielberg, who has not solved it, either. It involves man's relationship to those tools that so closely mirror our own desires that we confuse them with flesh and blood; consider that Charles Lindbergh's autobiography We is about himself and an airplane. When we lose a toy, the pain is ours, not the toy's, and by following an abandoned robot boy rather than the parents who threw him away, Spielberg misses the real story.

The film opens with cerebral creepiness, as Professor Hobby (William Hurt) presides at a meeting of a company that makes humanoid robots (or ""mechas""). We are in the future; global warming has drowned the world's coastlines, but the American economy has survived, thanks to its exploitation of mechas. ""I propose that we build a robot that can love,"" Hobby says.

Twenty months later, we meet Monica and Henry (Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards), a married couple whose own child has been frozen until a cure can be devised for his disease. The husband brings home David (Haley Joel Osment), a mecha who looks as lifelike and lovable as--well, Haley Joel Osment.

""There's no substitute for your own child!"" sobs Monica, and Henry tries to placate her: ""I'll take him back."" Cold, but realistic, David is only a product. Yet he has an advanced chip that allows him to learn, adapt and ""love,"" when Monica permanently ""imprints"" him.",1
1,EH_Doc2_Arnie-is-at his-best-in-this sci-fi-classic.docx,"Arnie is at his best in this sci-fi classic! 

Words: horror, Sci-Fi, fun, Action, Suspense

This film will always have special place for me, as aside from being one of the best horror/sci-fi films of the eighties; it's also a huge childhood favourite of mine. Despite the fact that I've seen it dozens of times as a kid, I have only seen it once during adulthood; and that single viewing was more than enough to remind me what it is that I love about this film! Predator works as a macho action film, gory horror and intriguing sci-fi, and despite it's short running time of just 100 minutes, it somehow manages to find room for all three. The fact that it stars action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger ensures that the film will always be favorably remembered. He's not a good actor, but Arnie always manages to bring that extra something to his movies. The plot is deliciously simple and follows a group of commandos that go off into the jungle on a secret mission. However, things go awry when it turns out that they aren't the only ones with weapons there. Finding the skinned bodies of the last group of men that entered the jungle is about to become the least of their worries...

The jungle makes for a great setting for an action sci-fi flick such as this. These sorts of films tend to be set in space, so seeing the action down here on earth is different; and the fact that it's set in the jungle, with it's dense foliage, ensures that Die Hard-director John McTiernan is able to bump up the suspense, as just like in the Vietnam war; the soldiers are dealing with an unknown enemy. The atmosphere really is excellent, and the special effects help to create a futuristic tone, while the suspense builds and makes sure that the audience are on the edge of their seats at all times. The action is great, and director McTiernan clearly knows what he's doing. It's fast and furious, and the amount of weapons on display ensures that the film is sure to delight fans of macho action films. The fact that the lead actor is a monster of a man doesn't exactly hurt the film either! 

Arnie isn't the only big man in the film either, as an assortment of muscle men, including ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura, and Carl Weathers; Rocky's Apollo Creed, among other B-movie actors, join him. The man himself also finds himself a very worthy ally, in the form of the movie's central alien. The Predator may not be as beautiful as the creature from 'Alien', but it's just as inventive. Here we have an extra-terrestrial that isn't merely trying to breed, or to 'phone home' - but one that is actually there to hunt humans for sport! Aside from being ingenious, the idea also borders on frightening. The gore here is gratuitous, but never goes over the top and overall, Predator is a film that never really got the credit it deserves. It is mindless fun - but its damn good mindless fun!

2,BDL_Doc1_Great-Scott.docx,"In an earlier review of ""Blade Runner,"" I wrote; ""It looks fabulous, it uses special effects to create a new world of its own, but it is thin in its human story."" This seems a strange complaint, given that so much of the movie concerns who is, and is not, human, and what it means to be human anyway. Even one character we can safely assume is human, the reptilian Tyrell, czar of the corporation which manufactures replicants, strikes me as a possible replicant. And of the hero, Deckard (Harrison Ford), all we can say for sure is that director Ridley Scott has left clues in various versions of his film that can be used to prove that Deckard is a human -- or a replicant.



Now study that paragraph again and notice I have committed a journalistic misdemeanor. I have referred to replicants without ever establishing what a replicant is. It is a tribute to the influence and reach of ""Blade Runner"" that 25 years after its release virtually everyone reading this knows about replicants. Reviews of ""The Wizard of Oz"" never define Munchkins, do they? This is a seminal film, building on older classics like ""Metropolis"" (1926) or ""Things to Come,"" but establishing a pervasive view of the future that has influenced science fiction films ever since. Its key legacies are: Giant global corporations, environmental decay, overcrowding, technological progress at the top, poverty or slavery at the bottom -- and, curiously, almost always a film noir vision. Look at ""Dark City,"" ""Total Recall,"" ""Brazil,"" ""12 Monkeys"" or ""Gattaca"" and you will see its progeny.



The ""human story,"" as I think of it, involves practical tests to determine if an individual is a replicant or not, and impractical tests (such as love) to determine how much that matters to (a) people, if they are in love with a replicant, and (b) replicants, if they know they are replicants. This has always been a contrived problem, easily avoidable in practical ways, unless (as I suspect) the Tyrell Corporation has more up its sleeves than arms. But to stumble on plot logic seems absurd in a film that is more about vision. And I continue to find it fascinating how film noir, a genre born in the 1940s, has such a hammerlock on the future (look at ""Dark City"" again). I suspect film noir is so fruitful and suggestive that if you bring it on board, half your set and costume decisions have been made for you, and you know what your tone will be.



Ridley Scott is a considerable director who makes no small plans. His credits include ""Alien,"" ""Legend,"" the inexplicable ""1492: Conquest Of Paradise,"" ""Gladiator,"" ""Black Hawk Down"" and the brilliant ""Matchstick Men,"" and his ""American Gangster"" opened Friday in theaters. He has the gift of making action on a vast scale seem comprehensible. I have been assured that my problems in the past with ""Blade Runner"" represent a failure of my own taste and imagination, but if the film was perfect, why has Sir Ridley continued to tinker with it, and now released his fifth version? I guess he's only... human.",0
3,YPL_Doc2_The_Farewell.docx,"The Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Lulu Wang’s second feature is a revelatory one, it arrives with all the fanfare accorded to a major new talent. Packaged up in all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. 



This isn’t the first time Wang’s told this story, back in 2016, the writer-director recounted a trip to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Her family, however, had issued strict instructions that no one discuss the disease around her. She hadn’t been told about the stage-four cancer ravaging her body. It’s a common practice in Chinese families, since it’s believed the stress of the diagnosis may only worsen a person’s condition. Instead, everyone came together under the pretense that they were celebrating her grandson’s wedding. 



Billi, a Brooklyn-based writer whose entered her thirties with no money and no prospects. Billi emigrated with her parents from Changchun, to New York when she was six years old. She still phones her paternal grandmother on a regular basis. But when Billi’s parents tell her the bad news, they also suggest she stay at home, since she’s too Americanized and thus too emotionally earnest – she’s bound to ruin the plan. Billi hops on a plane anyway.



The trip crushes her and rebuilds her in a thousand ways. When she’s finally faced with her grandmother, her face contorts into a snapshot of combusting grief. She’s trying so hard not to weep, she looks physically in pain. 





While there’s been no shortage of culture-clash comedies, they’ve more often than not focused on the purely superficial. Wang goes straight for the messy stuff – there’s no thornier subject than death, after all. It rears its head in myriad ways, but always with the same patterns of devastation. No family goes unaffected. Billi balks at the idea of keeping Grandma’s illness a secret, considering it’d be illegal to do so in the US, but Wang gives her the space to wrestle with that impulse, and where it comes from. Her relatives see it as implicit to the selfishness of Western lifestyles. 



The Farewell is one of those rare and precious comedies that is as hilarious as it is tragic. It’s humanity, encompassed. Never is this more evident than when the family visit the gravesite of Grandma’s husband. Billi’s father pulls out a cigarette, but Grandma insists he’d quit. “Let the man smoke, he’s already dead. What else can happen?” Haibin retorts. It’s hard to tell how closely Wang is modelling these characters on her own family, but each is beautifully sketched out, regardless of how much screen time they have.



At the center of all things, of course, is Grandma. She is the sun at the center of her own solar system, and in many ways the ultimate matriarch. Billi might be experiencing the worst cultural whiplash of her life – something Wang pointedly never offers a solution to – but it’s her love for this formidable woman that always manages to pull her through.",1
4,KWB_Doc2_Artemis-Fowl-Review.docx,"It took 20 years for an “Artemis Fowl” movie to come out, and now that it’s here, the film itself feels like it’s in a hurry to be over already. Irish author Eoin Colfer’s beloved tween fantasy series is nothing if not resilient, and now arrives under less-than-ideal circumstances in streaming form. But Kenneth Branagh’s big-budget extravaganza, based on a screenplay by Conor McPherson and Hamish McColl, is a glossy and empty exercise in world-building. The premise isn’t all that complicated—there’s an underground world of fairies, trolls and other mythical creatures that a wealthy, wise-beyond-his-years boy learns to navigate, who’s saddled with doing a ton of hand-holding narration for the audience.  And the titular character at the center of this adventure, the brilliant and rebellious 12-year-old Artemis Fowl, ends up being a dazzled, wide-eyed pawn rather than a driving force. We’re told early on by Gad’s scruffy, thieving dwarf Mulch Diggums: “Do not underestimate the kid.” But as played by sweet-faced newcomer Ferdia Shaw, Artemis is more of a spunky and subversive troublemaker than the devious criminal mastermind who anchors Colfer’s books. He’d rather surf than go to school, and do you blame him? Artemis has been softened to make him more accessible, which only makes him less interesting. Nevertheless, he is our conduit between the human world and the land of leprechauns, sprites and the like, and so we must follow him, dull as he may be. When globe-trotting antiquities dealer Artemis Fowl Sr. (a too-brief Colin Farrell) goes missing while on a secret mission, the younger Artemis realizes all the legends his dad told him over the years were true. He must team up with some of those fantastic beasts to rescue his father, as well as retrieve a valuable, shiny doo-dad that’s super powerful in the fairy world but dangerous for human use. It resembles a glowing, golden butt plug. This is essentially “Spy Kids” with greater ambitions and more elaborate visual effects. The sprawling and ornate Fowl Manor, which sits atop a cliff along the dramatic Irish coast, is impressive. Haven City—the underground realm that’s home to the LEPrecon fairy police force, run by a pointy-eared, bored-looking Judi Dench—She’s basically been asked to show up and run from a troll. But with his scraggly hair and shaggy beard, he looks as if he just wandered in from a Phish concert; he, too, joins in the adventure. Nevertheless, there’s always another fearsome creature, another giant set piece or fight scene, with a frantic score urging the action along. There’s a great deal of exertion on display but very little magic. “The time freeze is going to collapse any second now!” yells the tech guru centaur, a warning which is supposed to be significant within the craze of noise and the whoosh of flight and the pew-pew-pew of lasers being fired from ancient-looking weapons. But it’s all going to come crashing down soon enough anyway.",0
5,CEY_Doc1_The-Lion-King.docx,"Another month, another Disney remake of an animated classic. There are two reasons that this film exists, and neither is because anything was missing from 1994’s furry Hamlet. The first is to show off genuinely dazzling visual effects, technological marvels that give us photo-real animals in an absolutely convincing setting. The second is to showcase the ability of Disney and director Jon Favreau, following 2016’s reimagining of The Jungle Book, to assemble a world-class voice cast. But it’s still not enough to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the great king of the past.

It doesn’t seem right to describe this as ""live action"", when the visuals were created in the London offices of visual effects wizards MPC. Whatever its category, the immediate and overwhelming impression is so life-like that you expect David Attenborough to start narrating at any moment. Every hair and whisker is in place, every footprint raises a puff of dust. You'll believe that Pride Rock is a real place somewhere in Africa, watching over a landscape kept in careful balance by the stewardship of its great lion king, Mufasa. He is voiced, once again, by James Earl Jones, because some things are sacrosanct even in this mixed-up age. Our hero, Mufasa’s son Simba (JD McCrary; replaced in adulthood by Donald Glover), is just as cute and clumsy as ever as he takes his first steps into the big, wide world.

The big problem with this photo-realism, however, is that animal mouths are not designed for words, and their faces do not express human emotion. What we gain in realism we lose in expression, even in their limpid eyes; it’s distinctly jarring when these cats speak, and even more when they break into song. You can't help but mentally impose the performances of their 2D predecessors and see far more, well, animation in the older characters.

This emotional gap is somewhat covered over by a talented voice cast, with Chiwetel Ejiofor making a bitter yet seductive Scar and John Oliver snarking up a storm as the fussy Zazu. But it's not until Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen rock up as Timon and Pumba, respectively, that the film finds its groove. Favreau gives them their head, and they inject a much-needed shot of humour and energy into all the Shakespearean drama of Pride Rock. For a while they succeed in lifting the pace from a stately big-cat stalk to a full stampede, at least until Simba’s old pal Nala (Beyoncé Knowles-Carter) turns up and drags him back to save the pride from evil uncle Scar’s predations.

It’s all beautifully crafted and carefully conceived, without ever entirely justifying its existence. A few new songs increase the running time and chances of an Oscar, yet mean it sometimes drags before the lost prince returns to reclaim his throne. So, you might feel the love tonight, but perhaps not quite as much as before.

The great circle of life has thrown up a gorgeous, star-studded story, but trading feeling for realism means that we lose something of the original film’s excellence.",0
6,YG_Doc2_Monsters-University.docx,"This was the most enjoyable movie I've seen so far in 2013. In an overwhelming blockbuster summer of over-hyped excitement followed by mild to severe disappointment, Monsters University isn't just a good sign for Pixar, it's a good sign that 2013 can be one of the best years of film.

Now! On to the review! The story of the origin of the friendship between one-eyed Mike Wazowski and the blue furred James P. Sullivan in their freshman year at Monsters University. This film has homages to all the classic college comedy movies, and as it doesn't hold out on laughs for the kids and adults, it has a great amount of heart. Questions of what the future holds, and if our dreams are as possible as we hope they are. Punches aren't pulled on these questions, which is why it isn't just some animated movie to take the kids to see.

References to real college life are blended with superb imagination of the monster world. Rather it be a long blonde haired guitar player, or the horns on the school bus. All original voice talent returns and keeps up with the track record of great performances in Pixar films. Billy Crystal, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi grasp their characters and give them entirely different motivations compared to the original. Instead of a hardworking team, the two have a rivalry, and the supporting cast of their fraternity supply more relatability with a great variety of lovable monsters who help fill the story with even more heart.

The compatibility with Mike and Sully can be a bit surprising, for one is the study hard teachers pet, and the other a natural born scare student. And just as you think your more like one, the other comes in and you realize that even monsters can be scared of the real world just like us today. Fear of what life has in store, and if we have the talent to fulfill our dreams. This is a theme a lot of critics are missing, and shines making it worthy of being a great Pixar movie and prequel to a great classic.

The story isn't terribly generic as one may think, and every act is more different from the last. Starting with the clash between Mike and Sully, then onto the scare games, an intense series of games that declare supremacy of M.U. For the third and final act couldn't be more surprising though. It not only serves as a great climax, but something that we can once again commend Pixar for telling great stories in out of the box thinking that we should think paying for the $10 dollar ticket is worth it. And boy did I think this movie was worth it, for I will be definitely be seeing it a second and possibly third time. It wasn't a prequel we originally wanted, but it was a film that we and Pixar needed. And boy am I glad it happened.",0
7,MMC_DOC1_Boston_Herland_1917.docx,"‘1917’ takes audience on front lines of epic war saga

By JAMES VERNIERE | james.verniere@bostonherald.com |

January 10, 2020 at 12:27 a.m.

Charged by Gen. Erinmore (Colin Firth, here and gone), the men carry a letter to tell the leader of a regiment at the front not to charge the Germans (aka the Huns), who have retreated to the Hindenburg Line, because the retreat is a trap. Blake’s older brother, a lieutenant (Richard Madden, TV’s “Bodyguard”), is with the doomed regiment, adding to the suspense.

Even more urgent are the machinations of Academy Award-winning director of photography Roger Deakins (“Blade Runner 2049”), who was tasked with making “1917” appear to be filmed in one continuous shot. The non-shaky-cam effect makes us feel like we are there right beside the characters in the film, usually following them or just in front on foot at eye level, and it gives “1917” an immediacy, authenticity and a rare intimacy. If you like to feel like you have been thrown into another world by an “event” film, I suggest you see “1917” on the biggest screen you can find.

Inevitably “1917” also begs comparisons to Stanley Kubrick’s 1957 WWI anti-war landmark “Paths of Glory” with its tracking shots on rails inside the trenches. Equipped with extra armament, Schofield and Blake are war’s innocents sent to the slaughter. Schofield cuts his hand badly on a length of barbed wire almost immediately and then proceeds to get the most awful things smeared on the wound. Biplanes bob overhead. Primitive tanks lie on their flanks dead in the mud like creatures from a lost world. If the bodies and landscape had not been designed by “bio-mechanical” artist H.R. Giger, they should have been. The score by Thomas Newman (“Spectre”) is a knot of raw nerves and fear.

Co-writers Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns (TV’s “Penny Dreadful”) have created an ambulatory “Journey’s End,” a military “Alice in Wonderland” and a WWI-era “Saving Private Ryan.” If “1917” is a bit of a pastiche, it is nonetheless remarkable for such miracles as a crashing German plane that barely misses the protagonists, who save the pilot from being burned alive and proving once again that no good deed goes unpunished.

Did you notice the windblown cherry blossoms? Unlike “Dunkirk,” “1917” shows us colonial British soldiers, who fought to the death beside their native brethren. Hope is sparked by an orphaned French baby Schofield gifts with a canteen of milk.

But then English poet Edward Lear’s “The Jumblies” is used to summon the mad, self-destructive futility of war. “They went to sea in Sieve, they did./In a Sieve they went to sea.” Yes, they did, and they’re still going.

(“1917” contains graphic war violence and gruesome images.)

8,TJ_Doc1_ESOTSM.docx,"Joel, played by Jim Carrey, and Clementine (Kate Winslet) are the clashing, depressed, impulsive personalities at the center of Michel Gondry’s beloved 2004 movie, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Only we don’t experience their relationship in real time, following the linear rise and fall of the typical movie romance, with its structurally predictable melodrama. Eternal Sunshine certainly has the rise and fall, and more than its share of sincere, lovelorn melodrama. But per its by-now famous conceit, that story unfolds in retrospect, flashing up on-screen as it’s being erased from the lovers’ memories bit by bit.

It’s a surprising, clever sci-fi twist, even as the relationship drama it dredges up doesn’t feel at all like science fiction. 

The movie, written by Charlie Kaufman (who won an Academy Award for his work in 2005), bears more than a superficial resemblance to Alain Resnais’s 1968 masterpiecE. 

Eternal Sunshine has more humor and a more legible romance than Resnais’s grimly nihilistic, harrowing classic, as well as tropes that speak to the moment of its release. Clementine, played with unusual vibrancy by Winslet—who’d never get a role this quirky again—is very clearly a riff on the manic pixie dream-girl trope that haunted films of the aughts, though the term itself was not coined until 2007. But she’s also older than that archetype—both of the leads are. And her wild impulsiveness, a point of attraction for the usual dream girl, is here a bit more double-edged. It’s this zany unpredictability, after all, that led to her deciding to erase Joel from her memory without a proper breakup. Nowadays, we call this ghosting; somehow, in 2004, it was harder to fathom.

 The film’s fascinating conjecture is that the manic pixie girl and indie hero probably aren’t actually very well suited for each other—not because either one is a villain, but because of basic incompatibility. And yet they choose in the end to give their romance a shot anyway.

These are the moments that make Eternal Sunshine so indelible, even 15 years on. Most of the movie plays out like a spotlit labyrinth of banal events that suddenly become radical and strange as faces, gestures, and details gradually start to disappear. A car falls from the sky; distinct events bleed into each other nonsensically. In Joel’s mind, Joel and Clementine being to run ahead of the memories once Joel realizes he’d rather have them—keep the pain—than pretend Clementine never existed.

As heavy as Eternal Sunshine can get, it also never loses its puckish playfulness. iTs still a harrowing, and fascinatingly literal, depiction of a mind being cracked open. Still, I suspect that we mostly remember the film for the serious questions it posits. The film is undeniably a fantasy. But the feelings that Eternal Sunshine evokes couldn’t feel more grounded in the real devastation of a lost love—or the blissful fatedness of a new one.",1
9,KV_Doc1_In-Get-Out.docx,"In “Get Out,” an exhilaratingly smart and scary freakout about a black man in a white nightmare, the laughs come easily and then go in for the kill. The writer and director, Jordan Peele (of the comedy sketch show “Key & Peele”), knows how to make shadowy streets into menacing ones and turn silences into warnings from the abyss. His greatest stroke in “Get Out,” though, is to have hitched these genre elements to an evil that isn’t obscured by a hockey mask, but instead throws open its arms with a warm smile while enthusiastically (and strangely) expressing its love for President Obama.



Those arms and smiles all but engulf Chris (the British actor Daniel Kaluuya, going deep in a breakthrough performance), a photographer with a sweet pad, adorable dog and equally frisky, adoring girlfriend, Rose (a perfectly cast Allison Williams, from the HBO show “Girls”). The story opens with them preparing for a long weekend with her parents. “Do they know I’m black?” Chris gently asks. They don’t, but Rose assures him not to worry, and off they go into the countryside and narrative complications. Mr. Peele, making his feature debut, sets a cozy, innocuous scene complete with coos and loving glances, a tranquillity that shatters with an eerily inopportune deer crossing.



By the time Chris and Rose pull up to her parents’ house — a stately brick building with imposing white columns and rocking chairs on the front porch — ripples of unease have disturbed the calm. The nicer Rose’s parents, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener), behave, the greater the ripples. They don’t blink at him or his race (Ms. Keener is a virtuoso of the deadeye stare), but instead adopt the forced geniality of people who seem anxious to hide their discomfort. Missy’s the watchful one, while the voluble Dean cozies up to Chris, dropping embarrassing slang and relating an odd story about Jesse Owens, the black Olympian who shocked Hitler.



Mr. Peele is best known for his work with Keegan-Michael Key on their titular comedy sketch show, where politics mixed freely with the laughs. Together they starred in the 2016 comedy “Keanu,” a lampoon of action cinema that was a (slack) piece with the movie love that was a mainstay of their show. In one memorable bit from the show, heckling cinephiles voice their complaints (“this movie has an inconsistent visual language!”); in another, two friends realize that the reason the zombie hordes aren’t attacking them is they’re flesh-eating racists. “Get Out” expands on, and considerably deepens, a similar idea by turning white racism into disquieting genre shivers.



But Mr. Peele is after more than giggles and shocks; he’s taking on 21st-century white racism and its rationales. The opener — a black man talking on a cellphone on an empty suburban street — briskly sets the tone, unsettles the mood and announces Mr. Peele’s way with metaphor. He’s working within a recognizable horror-film framework here (the darkness, the stillness), so it’s not surprising when a car abruptly pulls up and begins tailing the man. You may even snicker because you think you’ve seen this flick before. Except that when this man anxiously looks for a way out, the scene grows discordantly disturbing because you may, as I did, flash on Trayvon Martin.",1
10,YC_Doc1_Blade-Runner-Review.docx,"‘Blade Runner’

When ""Blade Runner"" premiered in 1982, Harrison Ford disparagingly quipped, ""It's a film about whether you can have a meaningful relationship with your toaster."" It is, in fact, an amazingly sophisticated, sumptuously visionary treatise on the consequences of attaining god-hood. The toaster, in this case, was actually a genetically engineered ""replicant"" -- vulgarly known as a skin job -- played by a radiant Sean Young. And as Ford found out, the answer is, yes, as long as you know how to turn that appliance on.

Scott, a provocative visual stylist, brought terms like cyberpunk and retrofitting into the American vocabulary with this voluptuously decadent, sensor-overloaded portrait of Los Angeles as it might be in 2019: crowded, polluted, clangorous, damp, desperate and diverse. Patrol cars called Spinners carom through the canyons created by skyscrapers 400 stories tall and crumbling in the acid rain. Millions have migrated to off-world colonies, the spacious glories of which are incessantly touted by blimpy flying billboards. The rainbow billions left behind squeeze through the jammed, littered, neon-splattered streets as numb to hope as they are to the noise.

The screenplay by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples strays far from its inspiration: Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,"" the tale of a genetic designer, Sebastian (William J. Anderson). Sebastian plays a pivotal role here too, but the focus is on Rick Deckard, a retired detective who specializes in tracking down and destroying replicants who attempt to pass for human. Stronger and more specialized than real people, the replicants are sent off-world as slave laborers, soldiers and prostitutes.

Deckard, the best blade runner ever, is pressed into duty by his former boss (M. Emmet Walsh) when four replicants take over a space shuttle and return to Earth. They have come back, as their leader Roy Blatty (Rutger Hauer) explains, to meet their maker, Tyrell (Joe Turkel). To keep them from supplanting the men who made them, replicants have a built-in fail-safe -- a four-year lifespan -- and they've decided to discuss it with their man upstairs. ""What seems to be the problem?"" asks Tyrell. ""Death,"" responds Roy, ever the wry, cerebral psychotic.

Grand enough in scale to carry its many Biblical and mythological references, ""Blade Runner"" never feels heavy or pretentious -- only more and more engrossing with each viewing. It helps, too, that it works as pure entertainment. In its soul, it's a detective story complete with a glossy dame and a Chandler-style gumshoe suffering from a case of hard-boiled heartburn. Like Bogey before him, Deckard must shake off the troubles he's seen, the numbing shell, to get back in touch with his feelings. He becomes human again thanks primarily to the replicants who are driven by love for one another to develop empathy.

The filmmaker also has expanded on the unicorn references, which he says ""provoke Deckard's doubts in his own essence."" The blade runner has just confronted Rachel with the fact that her memories are not really hers, but implants borrowed from Tyrell's niece. When she storms out of his home -- Frank Lloyd Wright's Ennis Brown house -- Deckard gets out the family album, no longer sure of his own past. 

Every viewing of ""Blade Runner"" brings new discoveries -- a half-midget, half-mechanical toy's decidedly sexual response to Priss's appearance in Sebastian's living-doll-filled apartment -- and revitalizes treasured visual memories -- the way Rachel's copper irises give away her kinship to Tyrell's synthetic owl. Of course, those who've seen it only on video really haven't seen it at all. Just the shadow.",0
11,BDL_Doc2_Blade-Runner-2049.docx,"The good news about life on Earth, thirty-two years from now, is that people still listen to Frank Sinatra. In “Blade Runner 2049,” the land is the color of a corpse, and the skies are no better. The only tree is sapless and dead, and the only farmer is harvesting weevils for protein. The Voice, however, is unimpaired. True, Sinatra is no more than a hologram, crooning to a couple of folks in the shell of a Las Vegas hot spot, and yet, when he sings the words “Set ’em up, Joe,” you soften and melt as if it were 1954 and he were singing them to Doris Day, hushing a crowded room, in “Young at Heart.”



By a nice twist, there is a Joe around. He’s with the L.A.P.D., and he’s officially called KD6.3-7 (Ryan Gosling), or K, for short, but somebody suggests Joe, and it lends him a little flavor. He needs a real name, not least because it makes him sound like a real person—shades of Pinocchio, who longed to be a real boy. In fact, K is a Blade Runner: a synthetic human known as a replicant, physically redoubtable and emotionally dry, whose job is to find and to “retire” (a ghoulish euphemism) any early-model replicants who are still out there. They have “open-ended lifespans,” and immortality, as ever, is not to be trusted. Such is the premise of Denis Villeneuve’s ambitious sequel to Ridley Scott’s “Blade Runner,” which came out in 1982 and was set, with startling powers of premonition, in 2019. It starred Harrison Ford as Deckard, a cop who hunted down rogue replicants across Los Angeles—a joyless Babel, blitzed by neon glare and lashed by the whip of dirty rain. That was the future back then. How’s it looking now?





More wondrous still is Ana de Armas, who plays Joi, a digital program that in turn plays K’s live-in girlfriend. It is no coincidence that Villeneuve’s best films, “Sicario” (2015) and “Arrival” (2016), feature a woman at their center, and, whenever Joi appears, the movie’s imaginative heart begins to race. Upon request, she manifests herself in K’s apartment, switching outfits in a shimmer—a vision that smacks of servility, except that it’s he who seems beholden to her. Gosling looks happiest in these scenes, perhaps because happiness, albeit of the simulated sort, hovers within K’s grasp. And what a simulation: at one point, Joi uses an Emanator, which allows her to escape her virtual self and to experience mortal sensations—the prick of rain on her skin, naturally, and a tangible embrace. Has science fiction, you want to ask, ever conjured a moment quite as romantic as this? And how can it possibly last? It can’t; K gets a voice mail that overrides Joi and freezes her, inches short of a kiss. Love is deleted, and the Blade Runner gets back to work. The future, unlike Heaven, can’t wait. ♦",0
12,AH_Doc2_Coco Brings the.docx,"One of the pleasures of a new Pixar feature is the chance to be amazed by what animation can do. Sometimes you witness a big, bold breakthrough, like the computer-assisted rendering of fur in “Monsters, Inc.,” of water in “Finding Nemo,” or of metal in “Cars.” The innovations in “Coco” are no less satisfying for being of a more subtle kind. The grain of leather and the rusted folds of corrugated metal have a rough, almost tactile quality. Human bones, hairless dogs and orange flower petals look uncannily (but not too uncannily) real. There are moments of cinematic rigor — when the animators mimic the movements and focal effects of an old-fashioned camera in actual physical space — that will warm any film-geek’s heart. Not to mention the Frida Kahlo-inspired musical number with dancing papaya seeds.

“Coco” is also one of those Pixar movies that attempt a conceptual breakthrough, an application of the bright colors and open emotionalism of modern, mainstream animation to an unlikely zone of experience. 



The story takes place during the Day of the Dead, when according to Mexican tradition (at least as interpreted by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina, who directed the screenplay written by Mr. Molina and Matthew Aldrich), the border controls between life and death relax and the departed are allowed temporary passage to the land of the living. A young boy named Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez) makes the trip in reverse, which is not to say that he dies, but rather that his living self, through one of several metaphysical loopholes that the movie explains as it goes along, is transported into a fantastical world of specters and skeletons, who hold fabulous parties and raucous outdoor concerts

Miguel’s musical role model — and the source of the family embargo on musical expression — is a long-dead crooner and movie star named Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). In life and in death, he incarnates venerable ideals of romance and wounded machismo, or at least their show-business incarnations. 

The purer embodiment of that tradition is Héctor (Gael García Bernal), a ragged, forgotten ghost who befriends Miguel. What links Héctor with de la Cruz is a lurid story of passion, betrayal and longing. Their lives and deaths are a ballad whose meaning and melody Miguel must learn. In doing so, he will understand the thread that links him to both of them, and also the sources of the anti-musical animus that runs so strongly in his maternal line.

Coco is the name of Miguel’s great-grandmother, who turns out to be the heart of the story. Her mother, Imelda (Alanna Noël Ubach), is a furious matriarch on the other side of the grave, while Coco’s daughter, Miguel’s Abuelita (Renée Victor), is a no-nonsense flesh-and-blood autocrat. Their determination to silence Miguel’s guitar arises from heartbreak, and from the instrument’s association with the waywardness of men.

“Coco” avoids the darker tones associated with this theme, in the way that old murder ballads are sometimes reconceived as children’s songs. It’s reassuring rather than haunting, which is a shrewd and successful commercial compromise, but a compromise all the same.",0
13,RSM_Doc1_Bad-News-Bears.docx,"The Bad News Bears

Roger Ebert April 13, 1976



Michael Ritchie's ""The Bad News Bears"" is intended as a comedy, and there are, to be sure, a lot of laughs in it. But it's something more, something deeper, than what it first appears to be. It's an unblinking, scathing look at competition in American society - and because the competitors in this case are Little Leaguers, the movie has passages that are very disturbing. 



The movie's about a team that's surely one of the worst ever assembled (although I once played right field for one that wasn't much better). The kids are uncoordinated and demoralized and afraid of the ball, and wouldn't be playing at all except that a liberal city councilman has made them a test case. The members include a black, a couple of Mexicans, various other minority group members and, eventually, a girl. 



The team's obviously so bad no self-respecting coach would have anything to do with them, so the councilman hires a coach, illegally. His choice is an alcoholic onetime minor leaguer played by Walter Matthau - the sort of man mothers warn their children about. He doesn't understand kids, he's a loner, and he mixes bourbon and beer right in the can and drinks it in the dugout. Even the kids see through him. 



The movie comes by most of its comedy fairly easily. Matthau is, of course, an engaging performer, and the role's a good one for him as he sits in the dugout, hung-over and bleary-eyed, watching his Bears come out of the first inning 26 runs behind. The kids are good, too; Ritchie sees them in a fairly tough and unsentimental way, and lets them use the sort of dialog we'd like to think 12-year-olds aren't familiar with. Matthau works with the kids, despairs with them, finds himself beginning to care in spite of himself and finally goes out to recruit a ringer. She's Amanda (Tatum O'Neal), the 12-year-old daughter of one of his former girl friends, and over the years he'd developed her into a first-rate pitcher. 



But beneath this entertaining surface stuff, there's something else going on. We begin to sense how important, how really crucial, Little League is to the adults involved in it. How much emphasis they place on winning. If winning is the only point, how you win starts not to matter. Matthau gets caught up in the competitiveness, too, ordering his kids to deliberately get themselves hit with pitched balls, and telling a new recruit (Jackie Earle Haley, playing a neighborhood juvenile delinquent and natural athlete) to grab as many plays as he can away from his teammates. 



Director Michael Ritchie has made a specialty of movies about competition. ""The Bad News Bears"" is, in a way, his most harrowing portrait of how we'd sometimes rather win than keep our self-respect. He directs scenes for comedy even in the face of his disturbing material and that makes the movie all the more effective; sometimes we laugh, and sometimes we can't, and the movie's working best when we're silent.",1
14,AH_Doc1_Coco review charmer.docx,"Being simultaneously life-affirming and death-obsessed is a tough act for any film to pull off, but Coco manages it. This might start bringing Pixar studios back from the dead. I’d feared the worst from this movie’s Mexican Day of the Dead trope, expecting a tiresome parade of sub-Halloweeny horror masks under a sombrero of cliches. Actually, it’s an engaging and touching quest narrative, with some great spectacle, sweet musical numbers and on-point stuff about the permeability of national borders.

Coco is conceived on classic lines, certainly, but has that rarest of things in movies of any sort – a real third act and an interesting ending. 

We find ourselves in Mexico, where a kid called Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez) lives in a small town with his extended family, including his ancient great-grandmother Coco, who is poignantly on the verge of succumbing to dementia. Miguel dreams of being a musician such as the mega-celebrity singer Ernesto De La Cruz (voiced by Benjamin Bratt) who became a screen star and recording legend before being crushed to death by a falling bell in 1942. But, like Billy Elliot shoved into the boxing ring, Miguel is all set to join the family’s trade: making shoes.

The reason is that his folks have their own deeply internalised betrayal myth: Coco’s father was a vagabond musician who ran out on a young wife and infant daughter to chase his musical dreams. The family has sworn never to have anything to do with music and has even torn this man’s image from the family photograph: that vitally important image without which an ofrenda cannot be made for the Day of the Dead when the departed come back for a visit.

Miguel makes what he thinks is a sensational discovery: this disgraced ancestor was in fact the legendary lantern-jawed charmer Ernesto de la Cruz, and when a cosmic quirk of fate puts Miguel accidentally in the Land of the Dead, his mission is to make contact with De la Cruz and get his all-important blessing to return to the living world and pursue his musical destiny.

Of course, in the time-honoured style, Miguel needs a quirky/unreliable helpmeet for the journey and this is a deceased scallywag called Héctor (voiced by Gael García Bernal) whose body has a habit of collapsing and reforming with a xylophone clatter. As with all the comic wingmen in this kind of film, Héctor is a mix of Sancho Panza and Don Quixote.

Well, that is not what Coco is about; it is more emollient.

He, and we, absorb the news that the Land of the Dead is not the same as eternity. These vivified skeletons beyond the grave exist there only as long as someone back on Earth remembers them, which is why the photo piety of the domestic shrine is so important. It is a gigantic Valhalla of private and public celebrity. Oblivion means death and De la Cruz’s most famous song was called Remember Me. This is a charming and very memorable film.",0
15,RSM_Doc2_Billy-Bob-Guzzles.docx,"Billy Bob guzzles 'Bad News' beers

Roger Ebert July 21, 2005



Billy Bob Thornton stages a head-on collision between two previous roles in ""The Bad News Bears,"" a movie in which he plays, and I quote, ""a drunk who makes a living killing rats to live in a trailer."" The movie is like a merger of his ugly drunk in ""Bad Santa"" and his football coach in ""Friday Night Lights,"" yet he doesn't recycle from either movie; he modulates the manic anger of the Santa and the intensity of the coach and produces a morose loser who we like better than he likes himself.



The movie, directed by Richard Linklater, is a fairly faithful remake of the 1976 film starring Walter Matthau.  Thornton's performance is obviously fond of the Matthau approach, but finds a weary sadness in Coach Morris Buttermaker, who made it out of the minor leagues long enough to play in one major league game.



His team, the Bears, exists only because of a lawsuit filed by attorney Liz Whitewood (Marcia Gay Harden), who believes the Little League discriminates; she files a class action suit demanding that the league accept all players. The Bears end up with bad players in several categories: a black kid, two Spanish speakers, an Indian, a kid almost too little to hold the bat and another one in a motorized wheelchair. What they have in common is not their minority status, but their inability to play the game.



They revived my own childhood memories of Little League, which I hated; it was a meritocracy in which good players were heroes and I was pointed toward right field with the hope that I would just keep on walking. Well, of course it was a meritocracy. Sports involves winning, and winning involves skills. What I could never figure out was how some kids had always been good at sports and others would never be any good, no matter how hard they tried: Kids like me, so nearsighted that the approach of a ball had to be described to me by teammates.



The movie works on two levels. On the top level, it's a dark but traditional PG-13 version of a kid's sports movie, with everything but the f-word in the dialogue. The plot leads inexorably up to the last inning of the final game; we know the routine. On a more insidious level, the movie suggests that America has embraced a new approach to winning. Where sportsmanship and fair play once counted for something, success now often includes lying, cheating and stealing, as demonstrated in the recent criminal trials sending millionaire executives off to prison in chains.



What I liked most about the movie, I think, is that it undermines the self-congratulatory myths we cultivate about sports in America. It writes the obituary of good sportsmanship. Grantland Rice wrote ""It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game."" To which, according to the Baseball Almanac, the celebrated baseball team owner Gene Autry replied: ""Grantland Rice can go to hell, as far as I'm concerned.""",1
16,CEY_Doc2_The-Lion-King.docx,"For the uninitiated, The Lion King, is the story of Simba, a lion cub, who is dispossessed and made to feel responsible for the death of his father Mufasa, by his treacherous uncle Scar.

The cub's birth is announced in the opening sequence of the film called, ""It's the circle of life"", an evocative collaboration of music and animation that shows all animals of the African veld gathering to hail their future king. The cute little cub is held aloft from a dramatic spur of rock, and the future minions below hail him as ""the future King of Pride Rock"", in a staging that looks like the jungle equivalent of a political rally.

Of course, this coming together of all the wild beasts harps on the uncomfortable fact that many of these animals survive by eating one another. As King Mufasa tries explaining to his son, ""We are all connected to the circle of life,"" the narrative, all through the film, performs a balancing act between the fantasy of the story and the reality of the jungle.

Early scenes show Simba as a cute trusting little tyke who believes that life is beautiful. It is fun to watch him sing, in a lower and less-pantomime key, ""I just can't wait to be the king."" His enthusiasm and curiosity soon get the better of him and he lands in the wastelands, far from his kingdom. How he comes back to claim his stake as the Lion King forms the crux of the narrative.

The Shakespearean plot has dark corners, frightening moments and ancient archetypes like the crime of regicide. Some of the musical comedy numbers like, ""I can't wait to be king"", ""Circle of life"" and ""Hakuna Matata"" break the mood and are a hit among the audience, but the rest of the songs are far from memorable.

The voices of the ace star cast hit the right pitch and match the characters to perfection. Donald Glover as the grown Simba, Beyonce as his childhood friend Nala, James Earl Jones as King Mufasa, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar, Alfre Woodard as Simba's mother Sarabi, Seth Rogen as the Warthog Pumbaa and John Oliver as the goofy hornbill Zuzu have their moments of glory.

Visually, director Jon Favreau's The Lion King is fascinating and awe-inspiring, thanks to veteran cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, and visual effects supervisors Robert Legato and Adam Valdez, who previously collaborated on Disney's, The Jungle Book. With 3D Computer animation, each of their frames appear so realistic that the effort could pass off as a live-action film. Some scenes are just brilliant, and among the effects, the lustre of lion fur simply stands-out.

The film has all the trappings of the Disney template and is a fine remake of the studio's traditionally animated 1994 hit of the same name, nut the fact is after the initial attraction and moments of fascination in watching the extraordinarily life-like animals talking and relating to one another as human beings do, the novelty factor wears off. By mid-point the narrative meanders and the pace drags till we hear the song, ""A wee wee bum bum wae,"" which is the cover of The Tokens' 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight.' Thence, the momentum picks up. By the end, however, the predictability of the tale begins to wear you down. The 1994 edition had a run-time of 88 minutes, while this one lasts for 118 minutes. You feel the stretch.",0
17,MS_Doc2_Why I Left ‘Knives Out’ With Emotional Whiplash.docx,"Document 2:

In “Knives Out,” the writer and director Rian Johnson pays tribute to Agatha Christie and “Clue” in a star-studded whodunit that begins with the mysterious death of the wealthy author and patriarch Harlan Thrombey .Almost every one of his heirs falls under the suspicion of the private investigator Benoit Blanc at some point, including Harlan’s caretaker, Marta a woman so pure of heart, she can’t lie without becoming physically ill. True to the form, no one’s stories seem to add up, the plot thickens, and twists and turns are thrown in and at the center of the movie.

The film has been marketed as a “fun, modern-day” murder mystery, and the many rapturous reviews have echoed this sense of whimsy. But as “Knives Out” unfolds, Mr. Johnson reveals that he’s not interested solely in entertaining his audience for a couple of hours — he has something to say about class and politics in a bold, direct way that is rare in major American studio movies.

Unfortunately, Mr. Johnson’s ambitions on this front reminded me that sometimes, well-intentioned art can backfire and offend those it’s intended to champion. Through the character of Marta, “Knives Out” has a tendency to exploit its story’s immigration angle, which left me feeling uneasy as strangers at the screening I attended laughed at real-life issues I’m genuinely frightened of.

None of Thrombeys seems to know or care where she’s really from, each time guessing a different country. This is played as a running gag that is ostensibly intended as a critique of white upper-class liberalism. Yet Mr. Johnson keeps Marta’s background a mystery to the audience as well, never allowing her any cultural specificity beyond being vaguely Latina.

The film takes pains to cast Marta as an outsider in other discomforting ways. During a family argument, the youngest in the family, an alt-right troll, calls Marta an ethnic slur. In another scene, she’s called upon to clarify whether her family came to the United States legally, or “the right way,” as one of the Thrombeys puts it. Another member of the family hints that he could have her mother deported because she’s undocumented. Several family members assert, patronizingly, to Marta that they have “always taken care of” her. 

I can imagine Mr. Johnson views this pile-on as a way to call attention to the microaggressions working-class immigrants face daily, but it’s troubling to see Marta saddled with so much real-world baggage. 

After viewing “Knives Out,” I became upset as I tried to explain to a group of mostly white friends that I felt as I had seen an entirely different movie from the one they were raving about. I’ve been in some of the situations Marta endures — being asked to prove my citizenship, feeling unsafe speaking Spanish — and the movie brought up so many of these unpleasant memories repeatedly to little narrative effect. Instead of enjoying the twists and turns of an entertaining film, I left the theater with emotional whiplash caused by what felt like empty virtue signaling.",1
18,DLC_DOC1_Parasite_Review_Pleasures.docx,"On one side of town are the nouveau-riche Parks—a cheerfully culture-free husband and his lovely, silly wife raising their two spoiled kids in a resplendently modern house. (The house amounts to a major character in the drama. It’s a repository of genuine culture, by virtue of its architecture. What’s more, it is haunted, though not by conventional ghosts.)

On the other side of town, in a squalid apartment infested by stink bugs, live the Kims. They are counterparts of the Parks as reflected in a no-funhouse mirror—bummed-out husband, resilient wife, cheerful son who keeps flunking his college entrance exams, and cynical daughter who couldn’t get into art school, all of them down on their luck and out of work. But the Kims, as changeable luck would have it, are gifted hustlers, and they grab their main chance when the son, Ki-woo, gets hired as an English tutor for the Parks’ pretty daughter. With that beachhead established, Ki-woo’s father, mother and sister soon score jobs of their own with the Park family—under fake identities and false colors, but with a blithe alacrity that sweeps away all questions of plausibility.

The filmmaker puts his marvelous cast through its comic paces with exquisite precision and grace. Another component is the deliciousness of its humor, which plays not only on the Parks’ hilarious pretensions but on the Kims’ zest for their new roles as they take over growing areas of their employers’ lives. “What you need is vigor,” a suddenly authoritative Ki-woo tells Park Da-hye, his impressionable and eminently nubile student. He’s got it, and she gets it whenever he visits her room.

Instead of rich against poor, it’s a portrait of rich and poor in a precarious balance of mutual needs and benefits. “This is so metaphorical,” Ki-woo likes to say with a mixture of youthful pomposity and genuine wonder; the first time he says it is when a friend gives him a gift of a scholar’s rock, a hunk of stone that can represent whatever he chooses. “Parasite” is metaphorical too, but never calls attention to the fact. In its oddball specificity it simply stands—though never simply—as a representation of how society functions more often than not.

And it is deep. Just how deep is for me to hint at carefully and for you to discover when you see it—and see it you must if you’re open to one of the most remarkable films to hit the big screen in years. Suffice it to say that the light and delicate tone takes a gradual turn into Stygian darkness; that the title is more ambiguous than it may seem, since it’s hard to determine exactly who is living off whom; that the smell of the unwashed poor as experienced by the fastidious rich figures significantly in the plot; and that the shock at the end of “Mother” is kid stuff alongside the shock and awe of this climax. It’s a vision of the underclass rising up from far under, with all the delicacy of an erupting volcano.",1
19,JM_Doc2__Anchorman__delivers_comedic_goods.docx,"Sometimes the key to satire is to stay fairly close to the source. ""Anchorman,"" like ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" works best when it's only a degree or two removed from the excesses of the real thing. When the news director goes ape over stories about cute animals at the zoo, when the promos make the news ""team"" look like a happy family, the movie is right on target. But when rival local news teams engage in what looks like a free-for-all from a Roman arena, it doesn't work. Most of the time, though, ""Anchorman"" works, and a lot of the time it's very funny.



The movie centers on Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), the legendary top local anchor in San Diego in the early 1970s. Ron has bought into his legend, believes his promos, and informs a blonde at a pool party: ""I have many very important leather-bound books, and my apartment smells of rich mahogany."" His weakness is that he will read anything that is typed into his prompter. Anything. The words pass from his eyes into his mouth without passing through his brain.



As ""Anchorman"" opens, Ron Burgundy faces a crisis. Ed Harke, the stations news director, played by the invaluable Fred Willard, wants to add ""diversity"" to the newsroom by hiring a woman -- no, a WOMAN! -- as Burgundy's co-anchor. This cannot be. It is not right. It is against nature. Burgundy is appalled. The new co-anchor will be the efficiently named Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), and yes, reader, she was the blonde that Burgundy tried to pick up with the leather and mahogany line.



The other news team members include the wonderfully named Champ Kind (David Koechner), Brick Tamland (Steven Carell) and Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd). And yes, sometimes when they're together, they actually do sing ""Afternoon Delight."" They are united in their fear of adding a woman to the team. ""I read somewhere,"" one of them ominously warns, ""that their periods attract bears."" Odors play an important role in the movie. Hoping to attract Corningstone, Brian Fantana splashes on a high-octane cologne that smells, the newsroom agrees, ""like the time the raccoon got in the copier.""

If the movie simply focused on making Ron and his team look ridiculous, it might grow tedious, because that would be such an easy thing to do. But it has a kind of sweetness to it. Despite his weaknesses, Ron is sort of a nice guy, darn it all, and Veronica Corningstone, despite her desire to project a serious image, kinda likes the guy -- especially when he reveals an unsuspected musical talent in a lounge one night, after he's asked to ""sit in on jazz flute.""

When the news teams clash in a free-for-all, it's over the top. But a lot of the quieter moments of rivalry are on target. I have known and worked with a lot of anchorpersons, even female anchorpersons, over the years, and I can tell you that almost all of them are good people -- smart professionals who don't take themselves too seriously. But every once in a while you get a Ron Burgundy, and you kind of treasure him, because you can dine out on the stories for years.",1
20,TAM_Doc1_Reservoir_Dogs_1992.docx,"Now that we know Quentin Tarantino can make a movie like ""Reservoir Dogs,"" it's time for him to move on and make a better one.

This film, the first from an obviously talented writer-director, is like an exercise in style. He sets up his characters during a funny scene in a coffee shop, and then puts them through a stickup that goes disastrously wrong. Most of the movie deals with its bloody aftermath, as they assemble in a warehouse and bleed and drool on one another.

The movie has one of the best casts you could imagine, led by the legendary old tough guy Lawrence Tierney, who has been in and out of jail both on the screen and in real life. He is incapable of uttering a syllable that sounds inauthentic. Tierney plays Joe Cabot, an experienced criminal who has assembled a team of crooks for a big diamond heist. The key to his plan is that his associates don't know one another, and therefore can't squeal if they're caught. He names them off a color chart: Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink, and so on. Mr. Pink doesn't like his name. ""You're lucky you ain't Mr. Yellow,"" Tierney rasps.

The opening scene features an endlessly circling camera, as the tough guys light cigarettes and drink coffee in one of those places where the tables are Formica and the waitresses write your order on a green-and-white Guest Check. They argue, joke and b.s. each other through thick clouds of smoke; it's like ""The Sportswriters on Parole."" There's a funny discussion of tipping. Then they walk out of the restaurant, and are introduced in the opening credits, as they walk menacingly toward the camera. They have great faces: The glowering Michael Madsen; the apprehensive Tim Roth; Chris Penn, ready for anything; Tierney, with a Mack truck of a mug; Harvey Keitel, whose presence in a crime movie is like an imprimatur.

The movie feels like it's going to be terrific, but Tarantino's script doesn't have much curiosity about these guys. He has an idea, and trusts the idea to drive the plot.

The idea is that the tough guys, except for Tierney and the deranged Madsen, are mostly bluffers. They are not good at handling themselves in desperate situations.

We see the bungled crime in flashbacks. Tarantino has a confident, kinetic way of shooting action - guys running down the street, gun battles, blood and screams. Then the action centers in the warehouse, where Madsen sadistically toys with a character he thinks is a cop, and the movie ends on a couple of notes of horrifying poetic justice.

One of the discoveries in the movie is Madsen, who has done a lot of acting over the years (he had a good role in ""The Natural"") but here emerges with the kind of really menacing screen presence only a few actors achieve; he can hold his own with the fearsome Tierney, and reminds me a little of a very mean Robert De Niro.

Tarantino himself is also interesting as an actor; he could play great crazy villains.",1
21,OHU_Doc2_Parasite.docx,"Such a statement has become overused to such a degree that it’s impossible to be taken seriously, like how too many major new movies are gifted the m-word: masterpiece. So how do critics convey when a film truly is unexpectedly, brilliantly unpredictable in ways that feel revelatory? And what do we do when we see an actual “masterpiece” in this era of critics crying wolf? Especially one with so many twists and turns that the best writing about it will be long after spoiler warnings aren’t needed? I’ll do my best because Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite” is unquestionably one of the best films of the year. 



Bong has made several films about class but “Parasite” may be his most daring examination of the structural inequity that has come to define the world. It is a tonal juggling act that first feels like a satire—a comedy of manners that bounces a group of lovable con artists off a very wealthy family of awkward eccentrics. Can the poor really just step into the world of the rich? The second half of “Parasite” is one of the most daring things I’ve seen in years narratively. Bong holds it all together, and the result is breathtaking.

Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) and his family live on the edge of poverty. 

The script for “Parasite” will get a ton of attention as it’s one of those clever twisting and turning tales for which the screenwriter gets the most credit but this is very much an exercise in visual language that reaffirms Bong as a master. Working with the incredible cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and an A-list design team, Bong's film is captivating with every single composition. The clean, empty spaces of the Park home contrasted against the tight quarters of the Kim living arrangement isn’t just symbolic, it’s visually stimulating without ever calling attention to itself.

""Parasite"" is a marvelously entertaining film in terms of narrative, but there’s also so much going on underneath about how the rich use the poor to survive in ways that I can’t completely spoil here. Suffice to say, the wealthy in any country survive on the labor of the poor, whether it’s the housekeepers, tutors, and drivers they employ, or something much darker. Kim's family will be reminded of that chasm and the cruelty of inequity.

The social commentary of ""Parasite"" leads to chaos, but it never feels like a didactic message movie. It is somehow, and I’m still not even really sure how, both joyous and depressing at the same time. Stick with me here. ""Parasite"" is so perfectly calibrated that there’s joy to be had in just experiencing every confident frame of it, but then that’s tempered by thinking about what Bong is unpacking here and saying about society, especially with the perfect, absolutely haunting final scenes. It’s a conversation starter in ways we only get a few times a year, and further reminder that Bong Joon-ho is one of the best filmmakers working today.",1

But the curse has been lifted. The second “Frozen” is even better than the first, with dazzling animation and a more mature and tuneful score. Call it “The Icicle Strikes Back.”



Elsa once sang, “I’m never going back! The past is in the past!” And “Frozen II” has wisely followed that path. Instead of rehashing the 2013 film, and piling on complications involving the queen’s magical ability to freeze with her fingertips, we start fresh with a new, out-of-the-icebox adventure.



Our heroine now sits on the throne of Arendelle, but despite the highs of being queen, Elsa (Idina Menzel) feels a nagging void. She begins hearing a siren song calling her into the distance when a supernatural force ravages the kingdom. She believes that the ethereal song, and the source of the damage, are both from an enchanted forest her mom told her about as a kid. Could it also hold the key to her magical powers? So, off she goes, along with sister Anna (Kristen Bell), snowman Olaf (Josh Gad), doofy Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and Sven the reindeer.



The most important question for parents: What song will I be forced to play in the car on an endless loop until what seems like the end of time? That would be “Into the Unknown,” which Elsa belts out before embarking on her journey. It’s a rousing number that nicely sums up the movie’s more adult blend of darkness and whimsy, with more world-weary lyrics like, “I’ve had my adventure. I don’t need something new. I am afraid of what I’m risking if I follow you.” It’s also got a bang-up cover by Panic! At the Disco.



Once we’re in the woods, a land magically barricaded from the outside world, Disney’s prettiest landscapes and characters since 2017’s “Coco” come to life. The first “Frozen” vastly exceeded box-office expectations, and its sequel looks much more big-budget as a result. The hot-pink fire demon pulses with color, and the rock ogres look as good as any creature in “The Lord of the Rings.”



Don’t worry — it’s not all monsters and deep meaning. The music, by Oscar winners Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, is actually much funnier this time around. Gad’s Olaf sings a delightful song — as he’s being chased by terrors in the forest — about how everything will make sense when he’s older. And Groff sounds great as Kristoff during a country-tinged ballad that looks like a Carly Simon video.



That tune is called “Lost In the Woods,” but the “Frozen” franchise is very much found in the forest. Elsa’s powers and insecurities are still the star, of course, but this film should confirm to Disney just how perfect this entire ensemble of characters is.",0
23,MAM_Doc1_Tommy-Boy.docx,"""Tommy Boy"" is one of those movies that plays like an explosion down at the screenplay factory. You can almost picture a bewildered office boy, his face smudged with soot, wandering through the ruins and rescuing pages at random. Too bad they didn't mail them to the insurance company instead of filming them.

The movie is an assembly of clichés and obligatory scenes from dozens of other movies, all are better. It has only one original idea, and that's a bad one: The inspiration of making the hero's sidekick into, simultaneously, his buddy, his critic and his rival.

It's like the part was written by three writers locked in separate rooms.

""Tommy Boy"" stars Chris Farley of ""Saturday Night Live,"" the guy with the size 23 neck, as Tommy Callahan, the dopey son of a Sandusky brake shoe manufacturer. His father, Big Tom (Brian Dennehy), is proud of him even though he squeaked through college in seven years, and supplies him with an office and big responsibilities when he comes back to Ohio. Meanwhile, there are startling developments on the domestic front, where Big Tom, a widower, is engaged to marry the bodacious Beverly (Bo Derek).

Young Tommy is overjoyed, because Beverly has a son, Paul (Rob Lowe), which means Tommy at last will have the brother he always dreamed of. Paul doubts there's much to do in Sandusky, but Tommy proves him wrong, introducing him to the favorite local pastime, ""cow tipping,"" which means sneaking up on sleeping cows and tipping them over. In other hands this could have been the movie's only funny scene, but director Peter Segal doesn't have a clue about comic payoffs and bungles it before ending with the desperate director's ancient standby, as the lads fall in the mud.

The plot thickens. Or does it congeal? I began ticking off the story clichés: We'd already had (1) dumb son returns to family business and (2) unexpected stepmother. Soon we get (3) company gets in trouble and all workers will lose jobs, (4) it's up to the kid to save the day, (5) evil stepmother, (6) road movie and (7) buddy picture. The last two come as Tommy hits the road in a desperate last-minute bid to sell brake shoes, accompanied by his friend Richard (David Spade, also from ""Saturday Night Live""). Richard has been introduced as a resentful employee who doesn't think Tommy should get such a quick promotion. Now he becomes a sidekick, critic, rival and buddy, all wrapped in one ungainly package.



No one is funny in ""Tommy Boy."" There are no memorable lines. None of the characters is interesting except for the enigmatic figure played by Rob Lowe, who seems to have wandered over from ""Hamlet."" Judging by the evidence on the screen, the movie got a green light before a usable screenplay had been prepared, with everybody reassuring each other that since they were such funny people, inspiration would overcome them. It was Forrest Gump, I believe, who said, ""Funny is as funny does.""",0
24,MAM_Doc2_Dumb-and-Dumber.docx,"The purpose of a comedy is to make you laugh, and there is a moment in ""Dumb and Dumber"" that made me laugh so loudly I embarrassed myself. I just couldn't stop. It's the moment involving the kid who gets the parakeet. But because I know that the first sentence of this review is likely to be lifted out and reprinted in an ad, I hasten to add that I did not laugh as loudly again, or very often. It's just as well. If the whole movie had been as funny as that moment, I would have required hospitalization.

The movie is more silliness from Jim Carrey, who is beginning to grow on me. It's strange. His mannerisms, instead of becoming more wearisome from film to film, grow more endearing. I hated him in ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"" enjoyed him in ""The Mask,"" and felt positively fond of him here. He plays a limousine driver whose roommate (Jeff Daniels) runs a dog-grooming service, although business is bad for both of them and they live in a dump. (At one point a gangster suggests trashing their apartment, and decides they wouldn't notice it.) As the movie opens, Carrey is driving a beautiful but troubled young woman (Lauren Holly) to the airport. He has fallen instantly in love with her. When he notices that she has left a briefcase on the terminal floor, he races into the building and snatches it - thus foiling a kidnap ransom payment. Trying to chase after her onto a flight to Aspen, he has a nasty accident that is the movie's second big laugh, although not nearly so big as the parakeet.

After developments that will be familiar to students of sitcom and other formula comedy, Carrey and Daniels find themselves heading west in their dogmobile (a van that looks like a shaggy dog).

They intend to drive to Aspen, find the woman, and return the briefcase. Along the way they have the usual obligatory run-in with some tough guys in a diner, are pulled over by the usual cop, and are chased by gangsters, etc., etc.

The cop gets a bad surprise when he tests what he thinks is an open bottle of beer, but that gag misfires because its final shot is just plain not funny. That happens several times in ""Dumb and Dumber"": The movie sets up a potentially good joke (like the one involving a megadose of laxative) and then doesn't know how to pay it off.

The plot is lame, but that doesn't matter, because ""Dumb and Dumber"" is essentially pitched at the level of an ""Airplane!""-style movie, with rapid-fire sight gags. Some of them work, like the karate fight that ends with a guy getting his heart handed to him in a doggie bag. Some of them don't, like a curious scene where Carrey is hugging a girl and lifts the back of her skirt for no apparent reason: It seems creepy.

For Jeff Daniels, the role is a departure from his usual deadpan comedy roles and straight drama. He fits right in. The relationship between the two guys creates a lot of the fun, as they discuss their grim lifestyle and their bizarre plans to improve it.

The elements are here for a better movie, and Jim Carrey, I am now convinced, is a true original. In ""The Mask,"" he had the screenplay and production to back him up. Here, the filmmaking is more uncertain.",1
25,YC_Doc2_Futuristic-Blade-Runner.docx,"FUTURISTIC 'BLADE RUNNER'

THE view of the future offered by Ridley Scott's muddled yet mesmerizing ''Blade Runner'' is as intricately detailed as anything a science-fiction film has yet envisioned. The year is 2019, the place Los Angeles, the landscape garish but bleak. The city is a canyon bounded by industrial towers, some of which belch fire. Advertising billboards, which are everywhere, now feature lifelike electronic people who are the size of giants. The police cruise both horizontally and vertically on their patrol routes, but there is seldom anyone to arrest, because the place is much emptier than it used to be. In an age of space travel, anyone with the wherewithal has presumably gone away. Only the dregs remain.

''Blade Runner'' begins with a stunning shot of this futuristic city, accompanied by the rumbling of Vangelis's eerie, highly effective score. It proceeds to tell the story of Rick Deckard and his battle with the replicants, a story based on Philip K. Dick's novel ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'' In brief: replicants are manmade creatures that possess all human attributes except feelings. They have been built to serve as slaves in Earth colonies that are Off World, i.e., elsewhere. Whenever the replicants rebel, the job of eliminating them is given to a special, skilled hunter. This expert is called a blade runner.

Rick Deckard is the best of the blade runners, now retired. He is as hard-boiled as any film noir detective, with much the same world view. So when he is told, at the beginning of ''Blade Runner,'' that an especially dangerous group of replicants is on the loose, and is offered the job of hunting them, he can't say no. Even in the murkiest reaches of science-fiction lore, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

''Blade Runner,'' which opens today at the Criterion Center and other theaters, follows Deckard's love affair with a beautiful replicant named Rachael, who is special assistant to the high-level industrialist who created her. It also follows Deckard's tracking down of the runaways, most notably their white-haired, demoniclooking leader, Batty (Rutger Hauer). These events involve quite a bit of plot, but they're nothing in the movie's excessively busy overall scheme. ''Blade Runner'' is crammed to the gills with much more information than it can hold.

Science-fiction devotees may find ''Blade Runner'' a wonderfully meticulous movie and marvel at the comprehensiveness of its vision. Even those without a taste for gadgetry cannot fail to appreciate the degree of effort that has gone into constructing a film so ambitious and idiosyncratic. The special effects are by Douglas Trumbull, Richard Yuricich and David Dryer, and they are superb. So is Laurence G. Paull's production design. But ''Blade Runner'' is a film that special effects could have easily run away with, and run away with it they have.

Mr. Scott, who made his mark in ''Alien'' by showing a creature bursting forth from the body of one of its victims, tries hard to hit the same note here. One scene takes place in an eyeball factory. Two others show Deckard in vicious, sadistic fights with women. One of these fights features strange calisthenics and unearthly shrieks.

The end of the film is both gruesome and sentimental. Mr. Scott can't have it both ways, any more than he can expect overdecoration to carry a film that has neither strong characters nor a strong story. That hasn't stopped him from trying, even if it perhaps should have.",0
26,EC_Doc1_Garden-State-Was.docx,"""Garden State"" was written and directed by Zach Braff, who stars as Andrew. He has one of those faces, like David Schwimmer's, that seems congenitally dubious. He returns home to his father, Gideon (Ian Holm), who is very dry and distant, masking anger: Gideon is a psychiatrist who believes Andrew will never be well ""until you forgive yourself for what you did to your mother."" What Andrew did, in Gideon's mind, was to make woman into a paraplegic by pushing her so that she fell over door of a dishwasher. What Andrew believes is that he was a very small boy, dishwasher had a broken latch, and his father is full of it. Andrew's new life begins he recognizes gravediggers at his mother's funeral. are high school buddies he left behind. Soon he's high on ecstasy and playing spin-the-bottle at a party, and not long after that he's unexpectedly in love. Portman's success in creating this character is all more impressive because we learn almost nothing about her, except that she's great to look at has those positive attributes. The movie joins Andrew, Sam and his high school buddy Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) on an odyssey through wilds of New Jersey, contain stranger denizens than Oz. Mark is a stoner with a wide range of interesting friends, including a couple who live in a boat at bottom of a stone quarry, and a high school classmate who's made millions with invention of silent Velcro (""it doesn't make that noise when you pull it apart"").Andrew is awakening gradually long, sedated nothingness. He tries communicate with his father, he tries to reconnect with his feelings, and mostly he tries deal with enormous puzzle that Sam represents. What is he to do about her? His romantic instincts have been on hold for so long he's like a kid with his first girlfriend."" Garden State"" inspires obvious comparisons with ""The Graduate,"" not least in similarity of two heroes; both Benjamin and Andrew are passive, puzzled quizzical in face of incoming exhortations. presence of Simon and Garfunkel on sound- track must not be entirely coincidental. But ""The Graduate"" is a critique of world Benjamin finds himself in, and ""Garden State"" is world's critique of Andrew. All of people he meets are urging him, in one way or another, to wake up and smell coffee. All except for his father, whose anger is so deep, he prefers his son medicated into a kind of walking sleep. Ian Holm plays role with perfect pitch, making small emotional adjustments instead of big dramatic moves. This is not a perfect movie; it meanders and ambles and makes puzzling detours. But it's smart and unconventional, with a good eye for perfect detail, as when Andrew arrives at work in Los Angeles and notices that spigot from a gas pump, ripped from its hose when he drove away from a gas station, is still stuck in his gas tank. Something like that tells you a lot about a person's state of mind.",1
27,XL_Doc2_Secrect-life-pets.docx,"There’s nothing new about cute talking animals; they’ve been the center of animated feature films since the earliest days of animation. But in The Secret Life of Pets, the old schtick still works. We’ve all had pets, and we’ve all entertained the playful thoughts of what they do when left home alone. Will my cat secretly watch TV while I’m at work? Will the dogs in my neighborhood throw a crazy party? The Secret Life of Pets imagines all of that and more, showing what the various animals of one New York City block do the moment they’re left home alone.

The Secret Life of Pets, directed by Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney, is also a lot like another cartoon that imagines the private lives of non-human characters when humans aren’t around. The Universal movie borrows heavily from Toy Story, telling the same story of the old dog threatened by new  dog when Katie brings Duke (Eric Stonestreet), home from the pound. Like Woody and Buzz, Max and Duke don’t get along. One tries to get rid of the other until the two end up far from home on a series misadventures. Like Pixar’s first classic, Max’s gang of pet friends venture out into the city to rescue the two dogs – there’s even a moment that recalls a Slinky Dog scene from Toy Story when Buddy uses his long dachshund body to climb up a fire escape. You’ll find pratfalls and goofy gags in the movie, but the majority of the comedy comes from the robust cast of voice actors, all whom suit their characters’ personalities.

In many ways, Max is a lot like a kid-friendly version of the character C.K. plays in his FX series. He’s good-intentioned and naive, but easily cowers in the face of a bully. Jenny Slate is perfect as the feisty Pomeranian Gidget, while Kevin Hart voices Snowball, the angsty bunny leader of a gang of sewer animals who’ve been abandoned by their owners. Lake Bell voices fat cat Chloe, Bobby Moynihan is the energized pug Mel, Steve Coogan is the scraggly hairless cat Ozone, and Albert Brooks voices the hawk Tiberius, sounding much more menacing than the fish he reprises this summer in Finding Dory. The movie’s pets aren’t given a ton of personality through their animation, but the voices behind them bring each animal to life.

The animation in The Secret Life of Pets also looks great on the big screen. The movie opens with a soaring one-take shot that hovers over a glistening postcard-esque Manhattan, shoots down skyscrapers, and darts through the autumn-colored trees of Central Park. While it’s nothing innovative, the images pop with crisp, sharp colors that are delightful to look at.

While The Secret Life of Pets may not offer an emotionally poignant narrative like Inside Out, or comment on sociopolitical issues like Zootopia, it still achieves what it aims to be: cute, clever, and pleasantly enjoyable. It might not be remembered in years to come, but it’s good family entertainment, and sometimes that’s enough.",0
28,MS_Doc1_Knives Out’ Review Murder Most Clever.docx,"Document 1:

A sleek game of cat and mouse, “Knives Out” begins the hunt with a mysterious pool of blood and ends, well, telling wouldn’t be fair. 

Stuffed with famous and blurrily familiar faces, the movie takes the shape of an old-fashioned whodunit — the kind with mystery, suspense, entertainment, a corpse on an heirloom settee and a half-dozen or so shifty suspects milling about.

As in many genre exemplars, the main setting is a stately manor with dark corners, creaking stairs and a warren of richly appointed rooms shrouded in secrets.



The house itself feels like a mousetrap, which works for a narrative puzzle in which the parts keep shifting as the wood-paneled walls close in. The overall sense of confinement is perfect for the aims of a private investigator, Benoit Blanc. There isn’t a butler in the parlor, but there is a rather too virtuous caretaker, Marta Cabrera, who worked for the manor’s imperious patriarch Harlan Thrombey, who suddenly and rather flamboyantly croaks.

Johnson scatters enough hints to keep you busy guessing as characters enter and exit amid abrupt cuts and flashbacks. Things get complicated, though they never deepen, which seems by design. “Knives Out” is essentially an energetic, showy take on a dusty Agatha Christie-style murder mystery, with interrogations, possible motives and dubious alibis. Soon after Harlan’s body is discovered, the law questions the family, a finely curated collection of gargoyles presided over by a crisp Jamie Lee Curtis and a leaden Michael Shannon as Harlan’s children, and rounded out by Don Johnson, Chris Evans and Toni Collette, among others.

You spend a lot of time with Benoit and Marta, who are never as engaging as the size of their roles suggest they’re meant to be. Benoit’s part in the investigation is another mystery; he sniffs around like its lead dog but mostly comes across as a delectable chew toy for the director. When you first meet Benoit, he is sitting in an armchair, a nod to a genre staple and some teasing misdirection: He is, you soon appreciate, a hands-on sleuth if not an especially penetrative one. He presses witnesses, roams the grounds and sticks close to Marta, the most sympathetic and sentimentalized character in a movie that otherwise exhibits an exuberant skepticism about human nature.

As the inquiry builds, the suspects are stripped of their defenses, exposing pettiness, sharp teeth, false fronts and one pure heart. Johnson fills the frame with looming heads, folds in a nifty car chase and, in a striking tableau, sets loose the hounds. M. Emmet Walsh (who appeared in the Coen brothers’ “Blood Simple”) pops in, as does a photo of the magician Ricky Jay, who died before he could play Walsh’s role. Johnson’s own sleight of hand is estimable, even if his effort to add politics into the crowded mix rings hollow. The machine is what matters here, and he has clearly had such a good time engineering it that it’s hard not to feel bad when you don’t laugh along with him.",1
29,SPC_Doc2_Parents-Need_Know.docx,"Parents need to know that Moana is an animated Disney adventure about a Polynesian island chief's daughter who sets off on a quest to save her people. With Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson voicing demigod Maui and a score that features original music by Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, the movie should appeal to viewers of all ages. Scary, perilous scenes include run-ins with frightening, violent monsters (one made of lava, the other a giant crab) and with ocean storms and waves. Characters also go up against a ship full of adorable (but armed) coconut pirates, a character dies (offscreen), and a couple of male authority figures yell at Moana. There's also a bit of language along the lines of ""butt"" and ""dumb."" Otherwise, the movie should be fine for younger viewers, offering positive messages of self-discovery and empowerment. And Moana herself is a great role model, demonstrating perseverance, curiosity, and courage.

In MOANA, Disney tells the story of a Polynesian island chief's adolescent daughter who's been raised to become the next leader of her people. Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho) has always had a special relationship with the ocean and has grown up believing her grandmother's tales about how shape-shifting demigod Maui cursed the islands by stealing the ancient Heart of Te Fiti, which grants the power of creation. 

This engaging adventure triumphs because of its empowering storyline, which pays tribute to Polynesian culture, and because of its feel-good music, courtesy of Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. Teen Hawaiian singer Cravalho and Johnson (aka ""The Rock"") share a refreshingly student-and-mentor-like chemistry as the driven Moana and mythic Maui. Unlike any other ""Disney princess"" movie, Moana is completely romance free, never once bringing up its main character's marriage prospects. Moana's status as the island's next chief is unquestioned, and she's so busy trying to diplomatically solve her people's problems that the lack of a love interest is welcome. As Maui points out, she's a princess because she wears a dress and has an animal sidekick (in her case, a kooky rooster called Heihei), but Moana strives to save her island, not find a prince.

No other actor could have been a better fit for Maui than Johnson (himself of Polynesian heritage): He's as charming in animated form as he is in live-action adventures. Maui starts off as a self-absorbed demigod; he sings one of the catchiest songs in the movie, ""You're Welcome,"" about all of the ways humankind should thank him for his accomplishments. But as he grows to know Moana and teaches her how to navigate the ocean, his truer, kinder self emerges. The original music, which is a collaboration between Miranda, Disney composing alum Mark Mancina, and Samoan musician Opetaia Foa'i, is catchy and appropriately inspired by Oceanic music. Besides ""You're Welcome,"" the funniest song is ""Shiny,"" sung by Jemaine Clement, who plays a killer crab with an insatiable appetite for treasure. With its inspiring messages, charming characters, and memorable music, Moana is an excellent choice for moviegoers of all ages.",0
30,YPL_Doc1_The_Farewell.docx,"“The Farewell”, conjures a premise so rich with potential comedy, heartbreak and family weirdness that it can only have come from real life. The film, which announces itself as “based on an actual lie,” has a loose, anecdotal structure and a tone that balances candor and tact. Much of the charm and power of this story — about events leading up to a wedding that’s also a fake funeral of sorts — come from the palpable sense that it genuinely happened to someone.

The main character Billi, a struggling, artistically minded New Yorker who emigrated from China with her parents as a young child. In some ways, Billi is closer to her grandmother, who lives in the northern Chinese city of Changchun and speaks no English, than to her own mother or father.



Billi’s Grandma, always available for warm, easygoing cellphone chats, is a funny, candid, lively presence compared to Billi’s parents, who often seem weary, anxious and impatient. They have worked hard and sacrificed so much to give their daughter access to the American middle class, as they don’t hesitate to remind her. It’s a complicated inheritance, to understate the matter. At times, the competing demands of filial duty, individual ambition and cultural identity that Billi faces seem overwhelming.

Not that “The Farewell” is all about her. Billi’s identity crisis comes into view as the side effect of a larger and graver situation. Grandma, who has a persistent cough, receives a grim diagnosis. Her younger sister, who accompanies Grandma to her medical appointment, hears the bad news and decides to tell everyone in the family except Grandma, who may have only a few months to live. A party is planned to gather the clan to pay respects to the dying matriarch, though no one is supposed to shed a tear or mention her illness.

Billi is bothered by the secrecy, both because it seems unethical to withhold information from a patient and because it means that she must counterfeit her own feelings, suppressing her grief in favor of forced joy. Wang turns her frustration and bewilderment into a gentle exploration of the cultural differences and generational schisms that have, over the years, opened up within Grandma’s extended family.

Some relatives offer simple ways of explaining these divides. In America, Billi is told, the emphasis is on the individual, whereas in China family and community always come first. It’s probably not the first time she has heard something like that, and “The Farewell,” like Billi, treats such conventional wisdom with respectful skepticism. Families, communities and individuals aren’t easily summed up in a few catchphrases, and life is rarely a matter of choosing sides.

But there is also something hesitant about the way Wang turns this beguiling family story into a film, an unwillingness to push too hard into potentially painful emotional territory, which also keeps the comedy in check. A tearful confrontation between Billi and her mother, rather than bringing hard issues into the open, buries them in over scripted speeches. Wang appeals to the audience’s tact and good will, counting on our acceptance that some things are none of our business.",1
31,TAM_Doc2_The_Hateful_Eight.docx,"Quentin Tarantino's ultraviolent, ultra-talky sorta-Western ""The Hateful Eight"" is an impressive display of film craft and a profoundly ugly movie—so gleeful in its violence and so nihilistic in its world view that it feels as though the director is daring his detractors to see it as a confirmation of their worst fears about his art. 

Set in the post-Civil War era, the movie pits a group of criminals and criminally brutal lawmen against each other in a snowbound Wyoming cabin. Tarantino takes his sweet time assembling his core cast. He spends nearly a half-hour on a stagecoach ride that introduces a mustachioed fugitive tracker, John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell,  talking like John Wayne); his driver O.B. (James Parks); his prisoner, the treacherous outlaw Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who's being escorted to Red Rock for hanging; incoming Red Rock sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), a former outlaw that Ruth can't accept as a lawman, and Maj. Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), an ex-slave turned anti-Confederate war hero turned bounty hunter whose record of wartime atrocities makes Ruth distrust him and Mannix hate his guts. 

When they arrive at the cabin—a watering hole known as Minnie's Haberdashery that seems as improbably vast on the inside as Snoopy's doghouse—they are joined by more characters. There's a furtive and rather cryptic Mexican (Demian Bichir) who calls himself Bob, a former Confederate general (Bruce Dern), a smug and effete British hangman (Tim Roth, filling what might otherwise be the Christoph Waltz part), and a smirking gunman named Joe Gage (Michael Madsen, doing the Michael Madsen thing). The joint's owner, Minnie, is nowhere to be found, and her husband is missing as well. 

The character tally actually adds up to nine by this point, if you count the driver, but he's not really hateful, so maybe you shouldn't. And if you've glanced at a poster or trailer or IMDB, you know Tarantino will add more cast members, including Channing Tatum; Zoe Bell; Dana Gourrier of ""True Detective"" and ""Red Band Society,"" and Lee Horsley, who played Archie Goodwin on ""Nero Wolfe."" But Tarantino's never been the sort of director you hold to implicit promises about what you're getting when you buy a ticket. 

The movie is filled with playful and curious surprises: not just of the plot twist or character-revelation variety, but what might termed ""formal violations"" that make ""The Hateful Eight"" feel more experimental than classical. This is a director who hires the Mahler of spaghetti Westerns, Ennio Morricone, whose work he's sampled many times, to create an original score, then ladles it onto a film that is not a typically sumptuous revenge Western about characters' relationships to the land they're battling to claim, but something more like a crisply photographed stage play—think of Tarantino's debut film ""Reservoir Dogs,"" most of which took place in a warehouse, but with Stetsons and dropped g's, or a prairie rat cousin of Eugene O'Neill's tailbone-busting four-hour barroom fable ""The Iceman Cometh"" (""The Iceman Curseth""?), but with torture; rape; point-blank gunplay; multiple, possibly false identities, and gallons of blood.",1
32,XL_Doc1_Secret-life-Pets.docx,"“The Secret Life of Pets” is a kind-hearted, sweet story about the unique relationship not only between pets and their owners but between pets and major cities like New York. It may open with lovable terrier Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) speeding through Central Park in the basket of his owner Katie’s (Ellie Kemper) bike, but it’s more about apartments, fire escapes, roads and sewers than parks, and how a lovable group of animals is forced to traverse them on one crazy day. To be more direct, it’s an almost beat-for-beat rip of Pixar’s “Toy Story,” from the idea that we don’t know what our toys/pets do while we’re gone to the “new guy who mixes things up” storytelling dynamic. In the end, it’s too aggressively likable to hate—especially given its strong character design and excellent voice work—but simultaneously too shallow and forgettable to really register. The best animated movies give us themes to discuss with our kids when they’re over and work for both adults and children. “The Secret Life of Pets” is the disposable, summer diversion that many families will be looking for as temperatures rise and the start of school seems so far away, but most won’t be able to remember after they see it.



Max narrates this story of the day that his owner got a second dog, a big hairball known as Duke (Eric Stonestreet)—and the visual offset between tiny Max and giant Duke offers a Laurel & Hardy charm that I wish the movie played with more. When Max decides he’s not ready to share space and vie for Andy’s, I mean, Katie’s love, he tries to frame Duke for destroying their owner’s apartment. Before you know it, Max and Duke are on the street, hoping to avoid both animal control and a group of sewer-dwelling “flushed” pets who are organizing a revolution against the humans, led by the scene-stealing bunny named Snowball (a great, energetic turn by Kevin Hart). 

The pampered dog named Gidget (Jenny Slate, who I'd like to do voice work in every major animated from now on if at all possible) happens to notice that the object of her affection in the apartment across the way (Max) is missing and leads a posse to find him that’s made up of other house pets from nearby flats, including temperamental cat Chloe (Lake Bell), hyperactive dog Mel (Bobby Moynihan) and even a hawk named Tiberius (Albert Brooks), forced to fight his instinct to eat every animal with whom he’s now aligned. “The Secret Life of Pets” is an adventure tale, a story of two dogs trying to find their way home while their friends come to the rescue.

And yet there’s not much adventure to it. At a certain point, one realizes that “The Secret Life of Pets” doesn’t really have a lot of story, cramming so many characters into its brief 90-minute running time that they’re not given much to do.",0
33,TJ_Doc2_ESOTSM.docx,"On March 9, 2004, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, premiered in Los Angeles. The film went on to win an Oscar at the 77th Academy Awards for Charlie Kaufman's original screenplay. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below.

Charlie Kaufman has finally nailed that elusive third act.

The concepts for his mind-expanding screenplays for Being John Malkovich, Human Nature, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and Adaptation were all audacious and original, but the movies were running on fumes at the end. For Kaufman, the devil was in the details of finding his way out of the cerebral maze in which he isolated his characters. 

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is not only his most accessible and romantic screenplay, it's his most complete. The third act works like a charm and pulls all his themes, characters and conflicts together beautifully.

The film will appeal to Jim Carrey fans and women drawn by Kate Winslet, but there will be a strong core audience of young and older adults who can't wait to see the latest Kaufman brain-tickler. None will be disappointed. Focus Features should enjoy above-average box office for this spotless confection.

The references to the mind and brain in the preceding paragraphs are apt because the movie basically takes place in the mind of Joel Barish (Carrey). Barish knows his relationship with live-in girlfriend Clementine (Winslet) is unraveling, but he gets the shock of his life when he learns that she has had her memory of him completely erased from her mind. Rushing to see the inventor of this process, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), he impulsively decides to undergo the procedure, too.

Director Michel Gondry, a French music video director who made his directorial debut with Kaufman's Human Nature, beautifully orchestrates Ellen Kuras' cinematography, Dan Leigh's production design and Valdis Oskarsdottir's editing so memories merge and evaporate seemingly in a single shot. Joel and Clementine move through space as the scenes behind them change and morph like animation cels gone mad.

Carrey takes all his usual antic energy and bottles it up tight to portray an anal man both attracted and repelled by Winslet's free spirit who changes her attitudes almost as frequently as her hair color. Wilkinson gives the doctor such a calm intelligence that you almost forget what an appalling device he has invented. Ruffalo is goofy and unthinking, while Wood's puppy love for a former patient has a genuinely nasty side, the equivalent of psychological rape. Dunst is deep into hero worship of all the scientists, especially Wilkinson's gentle guru, without realizing the implications of that hero worship.

For all its science fiction plot, Eternal Sunshine is no special-effects extravaganza. The emphasis is always on the characters, their hearts and minds",1
34,AEJ_Doc2_How_to_Train.docx,"“How to Train Your Dragon” may not be the most beloved of computer-animated franchises, but it is one of the most reliable. “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,” gives the now-trilogy a pleasing arc.

In the first movie (2010), Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel), through a secret friendship with a not-so-fearsome dragon, Toothless, broke with centuries of Viking tradition to bring about a cease-fire (and cease-firebreathing) in human-dragon affairs. In “How to Train Your Dragon 2” (2014), Hiccup refined his leadership skills, ending the movie as a worthy successor to his father, Stoick (Gerard Butler), the chief of Berk, and his mother, Valka (Cate Blanchett), a pioneer in dragon whispering.



More bittersweet and less triumphal than its predecessors, and directed by a returning Dean DeBlois, “The Hidden World” concerns the exigencies that Hiccup faces as a leader, both politically and personally. If you truly love that dragon you trained, its message says, let him go.

As the movie opens, Berk is, in Hiccup’s estimation, “the world’s first dragon-Viking utopia.” But it’s not so utopian: Overcrowding is a problem at mealtimes, and the high concentration of rescued dragons in the settlement has made Berk a target for hunters. The most fearsome of those is a new villain, Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham, chewing on the cartoon scenery), who lives for the thrill of the chase and is always one step ahead of Berk’s peace-loving populace.

Should the residents hold strong, or must they abandon their centuries-old home? Is Berk just a state of mind? And is Hiccup finally ready for marriage with Astrid (America Ferrera)? Toothless, thought to be the last of his breed, meets a female counterpart and is quickly smitten. But is she on the level, or is Grimmel, who has Toothless in his sights, using her as bait?

Never the most sophisticated of digital dynasties, plot-wise, “How to Train Your Dragon” makes the most of these questions. If you’ve spent any time with these characters, it’s hard not to get swept up in the saga, and it’s easy to be moved by the bond between Hiccup and Toothless, who is, in effect, a very loyal dog who can fly and harness the power of lightning bolts.

The skill and detail with which the dragons have been rendered has only improved over the three films, and in sheer numbers, “The Hidden World” probably offers the most dragons per minute. The hidden world of the title — which Hiccup is searching for — is their secret ancestral homeland, depicted in glowing pastels that suggest a geological kinship with Pandora from “Avatar.”

But mostly the movie aspires to be goofy fun. Hiccup plays Cyrano during Toothless’s mating dance with his mysterious lady-dragon friend. Several former Judd Apatow associates (Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse) are back as comic relief, although you suspect that some of them — along with Kit Harrington as a reformed dragon hunter and Butler — stopped by the recording studio only briefly. And unusually for a sequel, this installment has the courage to feel conclusive. The series has earned affection for its characters and its disarming premise.",0
35,SXN_Doc1_Hidden Figures.docx,"Vaughan is one of the three real-life African-American women who helped decipher and define the mathematics used during the space race in the 1960s. Theodore Melfi knows when to let a visual cue or cut tell the story, building on moments of repetition before paying off with scenes of great power. For example, the absurdity of segregated bathrooms, Melfi repeats shots of a nervously tapping foot, followed by mile-long runs to the only available bathroom. This running joke culminates in a brilliantly acted, angry speech by Taraji Henson that is her finest cinematic moment to date. 

Henson plays Katherine Johnson, a mathematician who, in the film’s opening flashback, is shown to have a preternatural affinity for math in her youth. Her success at obtaining the education she needs is hindered by Jim Crow, but she still manages to earn degrees in math and a job at NASA’s “Colored Computer” division. In an attempt to beat Russia to the moon, NASA has been looking for the nation’s best mathematicians. The importance of the space race forces them to accept qualified candidates of any stripe, including those society would normally discourage.

The dialogue between the three women establishes their easy rapport with one another, and introduces their personalities. Vaughan is no-nonsense, Jackson is a wise ass with impeccable comic timing and Johnson is the clever optimist. They are similarly educated, though each has their own skill set the film will explore. The fears and oppressions of this era are omnipresent even when we don’t see them, and the film develops a particular rhythm between problems and solutions that is cathartic without feeling forced.

At the request of Vaughan’s supervisor (Kirsten Dunst), Johnson is sent to a room full of White male mathematicians to assist in some literal rocket science. The calculations have stumped everyone, including Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons), the hotshot whose math Johnson is hired to check. Parsons is a bit of a weak link here—his petulance, while believable, is overplayed but the overall attitude in the room made me shudder with bad memories of my own early career tribulations. I’ve been the only person of color in a less than inviting work environment, and many of Henson’s delicate acting choices vis-à-vis her body language held the eerie feeling of sense memory for me. Though she remains confident in her work and presents that confidence whenever questioned, Henson manifests on her person every hit at her dignity. You can see her trying to hold herself in check instead of going full-Cookie Lyon on her colleagues.

In addition to the unwelcome men in the room, Johnson also has to deal with the tough, though fair complaints of her grizzled supervisor, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). He and Henson play off each other with an equal sense of bemusement, and when the film gives him something noble to do, it hides the cliché under the nostalgic sight of “Bull Durham”'s Crash Davis holding a baseball bat.

While Johnson tries to keep John Glenn (charmingly played by Glen Powell) from exploding atop a rocket and Vaughan fights FORTRAN and Dunst for the right to be a supervisor, Janelle Monae is secretly walking off with the picture. Mary Jackson wants to be the first Black engineer at NASA, yet she’s hindered by Jim Crow practices. Jackson takes her case to court, and the scene where Monae wordlessly reacts to the outcome is one of the year’s best.",1
36,HK_Doc1_Dreams_Subconscious_Minds.docx,"Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. ""Inception"" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion, you really can't look away, nor should you.

""Inception"" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it.

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person's mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.

That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star. Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.

The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the ""Matrix"" movies. There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings.

However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season, there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.",0
37,OS_Doc1_Finding-Nemo.docx,"""Finding Nemo"" has all of the usual pleasures of the Pixar animation style--the comedy and wackiness of ""Toy Story"" or ""Monsters Inc."" or ""A Bug's Life."" And it adds an unexpected beauty, a use of color and form that makes it one of those rare movies where I wanted to sit in the front row and let the images wash out to the edges of my field of vision. The movie takes place almost entirely under the sea, in the world of colorful tropical fish--the flora and fauna of a shallow warm-water shelf not far from Australia. The use of color, form and movement make the film a delight even apart from its story.



There is a story, though, one of those Pixar inventions that involves kids on the action level while adults are amused because of the satire and human (or fishy) comedy. The movie involves the adventures of little Nemo, a clown fish born with an undersized fin and an oversized curiosity. His father, Marlin, worries obsessively over him, because Nemo is all he has left: Nemo's mother and all of her other eggs were lost to barracudas. When Nemo goes off on his first day of school, Marlin warns him to stay with the class and avoid the dangers of the drop-off to deep water, but Nemo forgets, and ends up as a captive in the salt-water aquarium of a dentist in Sydney. Marlin swims off bravely to find his missing boy, aided by Dory, a blue tang with enormous eyes who he meets along the way.



These characters are voiced by actors whose own personal mannerisms are well known to us; I recognized most of the voices, but even the unidentified ones carried buried associations from movie roles, and so somehow the fish take on qualities of human personalities. Marlin, for example, is played by Albert Brooks as an overprotective, neurotic worrywart, and Dory is Ellen DeGeneres as helpful, cheerful and scatterbrained (she has a problem with short-term memory). The Pixar computer animators, led by writer-director Andrew Stanton, create an undersea world that is just a shade murky, as it should be; we can't see as far or as sharply in sea water, and so threats materialize more quickly, and everything has a softness of focus. There is something dreamlike about the visuals of ""Finding Nemo,"" something that evokes the reverie of scuba-diving.



When I review a movie like ""Finding Nemo,"" I am aware that most members of its primary audience do not read reviews. Their parents do, and to them and adults who do not have children as an excuse, I can say that ""Finding Nemo"" is a pleasure for grown-ups. There are jokes we get that the kids don't, and the complexity of Albert Brooks' neuroses, and that enormous canvas filled with creatures that have some of the same hypnotic beauty as--well, fish in an aquarium. They may appreciate another novelty: This time the dad is the hero of the story, although in most animation it is almost always the mother.",0
38,SXN_Doc2_Hidden Figures (NYT).docx,"“Hidden Figures” takes us back to 1961, when racial segregation and workplace sexism were widely accepted facts of life and the word “computer” referred to a person, not a machine. Though a gigantic IBM mainframe does appear in the movie — big enough to fill a room and probably less powerful than the phone in your pocket — the most important computers are three African-American women who work at NASA headquarters in Hampton, Va. Assigned to data entry jobs and denied recognition or promotion, they would go on to play crucial roles in the American space program.

Based on Margot Lee Shetterly’s nonfiction book of the same title, the film, directed by Theodore Melfi (who wrote the script with Allison Schroeder), turns the entwined careers of Katherine Goble (Johnson), Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan into a rousing celebration of merit rewarded and perseverance repaid. Like many movies about the overcoming of racism, it offers belated acknowledgment of bravery and talent and an overdue reckoning with the sins of the past. Mr. Melfi, trusts his own skill, the intrinsic interest of the material and — above all — the talent and dedication of the cast. From one scene to the next, you may know more or less what is coming, but it is never less than delightful to watch these actors at work.

Start with the three principals, whose struggles at NASA take place as the agency is scrambling to send an astronaut into orbit. Katherine Goble is the central hidden figure, a mathematical prodigy played with perfect nerd charisma by Taraji P. Henson. Katherine is plucked from the computing room and assigned to a team that will calculate the launch coordinates and trajectory for an Atlas rocket. She receives a cold welcome — particularly from an engineer named Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) — and is not spared the indignities facing a black woman in a racially segregated, gender-stratified workplace. The only bathroom she is allowed to use is in a distant building, and she horrifies her new co-workers when she helps herself to a cup of coffee.

Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) and Mary (Janelle Monáe) also face discrimination. Dorothy, who is in charge of several dozen computers, is repeatedly denied promotion to supervisor and treated with condescension by her immediate boss (Kirsten Dunst). The Polish-born engineer (Olek Krupa) with whom Mary works is more enlightened, but Mary runs into the brick wall of Virginia’s Jim Crow laws when she tries to take graduate-level physics courses.

“Hidden Figures” effectively conveys the poisonous normalcy of white supremacy, and the main characters’ determination to pursue their ambitions in spite of it and to live normal lives in its shadow. The racism they face does not depend on the viciousness or virtue of individual white people, and for the most part the white characters are not treated as heroes for deciding, at long last, to behave decently. Two of them, however, are singled out for commendation: John Glenn, portrayed by Glen Powell as a natural democrat with no time for racial hierarchies; and Al Harrison, the head of Katherine’s group, for whom the success of the mission is more important than color.

Kevin Costner, who plays Al, with the flattop haircut and heavy-framed glasses, gives Al an aura of midcentury no-nonsense masculine competence. He desegregates the NASA bathrooms with a sledgehammer and stands up for Katherine in quieter but no less emphatic ways when her qualifications are challenged.",1
39,CEM_Doc2_Just_Go_With.docx,"The people in this movie are dumber than a box of Tinkertoys. One fears they're so unfortunate it's not Politically Correct to laugh at them. That's not a problem because ""Just Go With It"" is so rarely funny. Here is a story that began as a French farce. Then it was adapted into a Broadway play named ""Cactus Flower."" Then the play was made into a movie. Now it has been made into another movie. This process has diluted it like a homeopathic medicine, so that not an atom of the original formula can be found.

Consider. Danny (Adam Sandler) broke off his wedding at the last minute, but continues to wear the wedding ring. Women find the ring seductive, and cannot resist having sex with a married man. Therefore, most (not all) of the women in his life are stupid. This works for him for approximately 25 years. In the meantime, he becomes a famous plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills. He is assisted by Nurse Katherine (Jennifer Aniston), who has two kids.

On the one day he isn't wearing his ring, he spends an idyllic night in the beach with the delicious 23-year-old Palmer (Brooklyn Decker). Then she finds the ring in his pocket and thinks he is married, and he lies and says yes, but his divorce is almost final. She insists on meeting his wife. He makes Nurse Katherine pretend to be his wife. He buys her several thousand dollars worth of clothes for her one (1) meeting with Palmer.

For reasons having to do with Palmer's love of children, they all fly to Hawaii together with Nurse Katherine's two kids and Danny's high school buddy Eddie (Nick Swardson), who pretends to be the Nurse's fiancé. Eddie disguises himself with thick glasses and the worst German accent since the guy who worshipped Hitler in ""The Producers."" He also brandishes a meerschaum pipe, because everyone who has seen ""Inglourious Basterds"" knows all Germans smoke meerschaum pipes.

This might work as a farce. Maybe it did, in France. It worked as a Broadway play by Abe Burrows. It worked as a 1969 movie with Walter Matthau, Ingrid Bergman as the nurse and Goldie Hawn as the young girl. It doesn't work now. The problem is the almost paralytic sweetness of the characters. Nobody is really trying to get away with anything. They're just trying to do the right thing in an underhanded way. Walter Matthau was crafty in the cradle. Goldie Hawn was the definitive ditz. Ingrid Bergman was *sigh*. The 1969 screenplay was by I.A.L. Diamond, who knew a thing or two about farce when he wrote ""Some Like It Hot."" They made a good movie.

So nice is everyone here that even the completely surplus character played by Nicole Kidman is undermined. She plays the old standby, the popular girl who was mean to Nurse Katherine in high school. We know the cliché. Kidman could have done something with it, but the screenplay gives her nowhere to go It's painful to endure the cloying scene where they kiss and make up.",1

Words: Action, Sci-Fi, Adrenaline-pumping, thrilling, best

Predator (1987) is a masterpiece - the greatest bad-ass best Sci-Fi action film of all time. I love this Sci-Fi action flick to death! Predator is Epic Sci-fi Action movie of the 80's, my number 1 personal favorite best action sci-fi classic film of all time. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers and the rest of his team are all the time in the jungle hunted by an alien Predator, that's what makes this film and story more interesting than. This is very fast paced action flick, you never get bored or you fall a sleep. My favorite best Action Sci-Fi Flick movie was always Predator and It always will be. The best action movie ever made! Major Alan ""Dutch"" Schaefer is my comic book hero this is my hero. The hunted becomes the hunter on the end of the film when he camouflage with mud to defend him self against the Predator-ultimate hunter and hunts him down by setting booby-traps for him the best! 

In the remote jungle of a Central American country, an elite group of commandos led by Major Dutch Schaeffer, embarks on a CIA mission to clear out a guerrilla stronghold and rescue the remaining hostages. However, the hunters become the hunted when a highly intelligent, otherworldly being slowly and methodically starts killing off members of Dutch's team. Possessing a chameleon like camouflaging ability and a deadly alien arsenal, the creature tracks down the soldiers one by one.

This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with an $98 million budget (in 1987!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used.

This movie stars are all believable in their roles and even add to the humor that this movie has. This is obviously the best of the Predator movies and still one of the most highly liked thrillers today. And let's all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall, who died a year after he had made Predator 2.

Predator is the 1980's most adrenaline-pumping, action-packed, violent mainstream film of the decade, a film replete with nearly non-stop action, loud, messy violence, huge muscles, big guns, and an extraterrestrial killing machine with infrared sight and a laser cannon on his shoulder thrown in for good measure. 

The film's budget was around $15 million. 20th Century Fox released it in the United States on June 12, 1987, where it grossed $59,735,548. Initial critical reaction was mixed; criticism focused on the thin plot.

10/10 My all time favorite action film I love it to death it is my personal favorite action film of all time. Predator is a masterpiece, one of the best Sci-Fi action films of al time. I own the DVD and I also own the Blu-ray disc. I used to had ultimate hunter edition on Blu-ray but the subtitles were awful and the picture was lousy and wax like plastic.

41,CEM_Doc1_50_First_Dates.docx,"Just in time for Valentine's Day, ""50 First Dates"" is a spin on the ""Groundhog Day"" notion of a day that keeps repeating itself. This time, though, the recycling takes place entirely inside the mind of Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), who was in an accident that caused short-term memory loss. Every night while she sleeps, the slate of her memory is wiped clean, and when she wakes up in the morning, she remembers everything that happened up to the moment of the accident, but nothing that happened afterward.

Is this possible? I'd like to bring in Oliver Sacks for a second opinion. Seems to me that short-term memory loss doesn't work on a daily timetable, but is more like the affliction of ""10-Second Tom,"" a character in the movie who reboots every 10 seconds.

Still, this isn't a psychiatric docudrama but a lighthearted romantic comedy, and the premise works to provide Adam Sandler and Barrymore with a sweet story. They work well together, as they showed in ""The Wedding Singer""; they have the same tone of smiling, coy sincerity.

The movie is sort of an experiment for Sandler. He reveals the warm side of his personality, and leaves behind the hostility, anger and gross-out humor. To be sure, there's projectile vomiting on a vast scale in an opening scene of the movie, but it's performed by a walrus, not one of the human characters, and the walrus feels a lot better afterward. This is a kinder and gentler Adam Sandler.

He plays Henry Roth, a marine biologist at a Hawaiian sea world, healing walruses, sea lions and dolphins and moonlighting as an expert in one-night stands. He romances babes who are in Hawaii on vacation, and then forgets them when they go home, so imagine his amazement when he meets Lucy and finds that she forgets him every night.

Lucy is surrounded by a lot of support (her loving dad and the staff at the local diner), and they're dubious about the motives of this guy who says he's so much in love he's willing to start over with this girl every morning.

You'd think it would be hard to construct an arc for a story that starts fresh every day, but George Wing's screenplay ingeniously uses videotape to solve that problem -- so that Lucy gets a briefing every morning on what she has missed, and makes daily notes in a journal about her strange romance with Henry. Eventually this leads her to conclude that it's unfair to Henry to have to endure her daily memory losses, and she says she wants to break up. Of course the formula requires this, but how the movie solves it is kind of charming.

The movie doesn't have the complexity and depth of ""Groundhog Day"" (which I recently saw described as ""the most spiritual film of our time""), but as entertainment it's ingratiating and lovable. And it suggests that Sandler, whose movies are so often based on hostility, has another speed, another tone, that plays very nicely.",1
42,EC_Doc2_But-a-year.docx,"But a year later, a much more monumental event happened. In 2005, we all sat down in our fading Kerry/Edwards T-shirts, turned off the news coverage about the ongoing wars and irreparable financial disaster George Bush was sinking us into, slid our Garden State DVDs into our PS2s, and realized: Hey, wait a minute. This movie fucking sucks.Garden State was released 11 years ago, and in 2005, for a nation of coddled adult babies, it was the indie snoozefest that had been done to death several times already and would be done many more times as a result of its success and would likely star Zooey Deschanel and/or Michael Cera. It was a movie for those of us who felt bad for ourselves, thought a lot about how we felt bad for ourselves, and sat around talking with our fellow self-feel-badders about how we felt bad for ourselves.And this Braff guy who starred in it, the talking Q-Tip from Scrubs, he was just like us, the over-medicated, therapist-dependent twenty-somethings who had a hard time feeling feelings because Braff was super dull and super boring and super annoying and super other stuff we wanted to project onto him, which was easy since he had the shapeless, colorless face of a blank avatar.Braff spent most of the movie having those very trite conversations we all suffered through in our college years—blatherings about, you know, vapid privileged problems, like swimming and Coldplay and being a struggling actor. He introduced us to a cast of equally emotionally stunted characters with personality disorders and also the Bazinga! guy. Braff’s image as a mopey unintentionally comedic sensi boy positioned him to be the next David Schwimmer. In one of the most ham-handed scenes, Braff and Portman perched at the edge of a very fake CGI-ed quarry, a chasm which itself was a metaphor for acting like a whiny emo virgin. They stood there in the rain, and Braff, who stopped being a baby for one second to be an even bigger baby. Then there’s the soundtrack. What a collection of shit! It was like Braff pulled a bunch of rejects from a Wes Anderson movie and mashed them together with the fitting room tunes of Urban Outfitters. Imagine the thrill we, the unfuckable indie rock nerds, felt about having our boring tastes pandered to in a big theatrical release. And getting away with it, no less! The movie wasn’t Zach Braff’s fault. It wasn’t Natalie Portman’s, either. It was all of our faults for creating this indie cool culture inhabited by self-absorbed special pain victims that allowed pieces of narcissistic entertainment like this movie and its soundtrack to become commercially successful. We all just realized it a year too late. Garden State was not as deep as the CGI abyss Zach Braff was screaming into. It was as shallow as the grave Natalie Portman dug for her dead hamster. It turned out it wasn't a chasm we were gazing into, it was our own navels.",1
43,HK_Doc2_Dreams_Subconscious_Minds.docx,"Dom Cobb leads a highly skilled team, specializing in stealing secrets from people's minds by entering their dreams. When they are hired by a mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea.

Inception has a multi-layered plot, quite literally in fact. It focuses on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story- telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It has been described by critics as ""a film that rewards intellect"", and I can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you awestruck. The best part about it is that while you may feel you need to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances are, you will probably want to.

Christopher Nolan brings his unique vision to the screen with the help of a star-studded cast, including the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days Of Summer), Ellen Page (Juno), Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), and Michael Caine (The Dark Knight), as well some amazing photography by long time collaborator Wally Pfister. The thrilling music in the film is provided by none other than Hans Zimmer, who was also set the mood for Nolan's previous film, The Dark Knight.

While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely complex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind. Technical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together as beautifully. The emotional depth and explosive action complement each other perfectly, delivering a film that is at the same time both heart- wrenching and heart-pounding. It's a film that manages to engross you with its complexities, yet comes together seamlessly, and will have you at the edge of your seat, quite literally from start to finish.

Inception is magnificent.",0
44,DB_Doc1_Get_Out_Review.docx,"In the opening moments of Get Out, as a mysterious, threatening figure stalks a wary black man who’s lost his way in a suburban neighborhood at night, writer-director Jordan Peele declares his intentions in two clear ways. First: he openly invokes the death of Trayvon Martin, a black 17-year-old killed in a gated community by a man who assumed he was a criminal because of his skin color. Second: Peele lets the scene play out like a familiar horror movie sequence, complete with stabbing musical jump-cues, canny tension-building camera movement, and sudden, shocking action. Like the equally memorable opening scene of the recent horror movie It Follows, the initial moments of Get Out are a reminder that no matter how domestic and low-key the film becomes at other times, it’s first and foremost a horror movie, with an agenda of unsettling the audience, then scaring the hell out of them. But it’s also an overtly political movie, one that evokes current racial tensions both to make the story more relevant, and to make it more frightening. 

Get Out is specific and pointed about white privilege and power and the inequities it creates, not just on a broad societal level, but in situations as small as social gatherings and casual conversations. There’s a lot of comic potential in the ideas Peele plays with here, in the possibility that any given racially tinged awkwardness between strangers might just be insensitivity, or might mask something much darker and more savage. But there’s a lot of paralyzing terror in that idea, too. 

From the start, Peele uses racial tension to crank up the narrative tension. When Chris’ white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) invites him to meet her parents at their beautifully appointed, isolated lake house in a rich suburb, he hedges. She hasn’t told her parents he’s black, and he anticipates a potentially uncomfortable scene. But her folks, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener), are welcoming and friendly. Dean is an awkwardly forceful would-be liberal ally — among other things, he claims he wanted to vote for Obama for a third term, and brags about what an honor it was when his father lost a potential Olympic competition slot to Jesse Owens. But otherwise, the entire Armitage family seems genial enough. Still, Chris is unnerved by the alternating aggression and beaming artificiality of the Armitages’ black housekeeper and groundskeeper, Walter and Georgina.

Like so much of Key & Peele’s comedy, Get Out is refreshing in its naked, frank aggression about confronting racial issues, with comedy, drama, and sharp, unsparing insight. The film isn’t subtle about how unhappy Chris is to be the only black person in a crowd, or how relieved he is to share his worries with a black friend. Peele doesn’t disguise the story’s application to current social fears about cultural appropriation and assimilation, or about prejudice, abuse of power, and the reckless, unchecked use of authority that produced casualties like Darrien Hunt, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice. And by acknowledging the tension, he builds a platform to channel it all into tense, morbid terror. In the process, he creates one of the decade’s most openly meaningful horror films, and also one of its hands-down scariest.",1
45,JKS_Doc2_The-Hobbit_-An.docx,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Review



Peter Jackson and company brought a series of books to the big screen that many thought to be un-filmable when they struck gold with The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Returning to the world of J. R. R. Tolkien by tackling the precursor novel to The Lord of the Rings and its appendices, Jackson brings back all the charm and wonderment of Tolkien’s mystical world, and then crushes it under the obtrusive fist of the films HFR (High Frame resolution) 48 FPS presentation.



Bilbo Baggins leads a simple life that he doesn’t care to see change. Unbeknownst to Bilbo, the great wizard Gandalf the Grey has signed Bilbo up to take part in a perilous journey for which he is ill equipped. Gandalf has agreed to help a group of thirteen dwarves reclaim their home from the great dragon Smaug. To complete their plans of re-capturing their home, Gandalf has convinced the dwarves they need a Hobbit to fulfill the role of, burglar; someone who can sneak in and out of the dragon’s lair without being detected. Reluctant to join up at first, Bilbo has a change of heart and heads off on the adventure of a lifetime.



Story is everything when it comes to a great film. I’ll never stopped saying it–a film can have a great story and succeed through spotty cinematography or poor sound, yet the newfangled 48FPS style of The Hobbit is the exception to the rule. The Lord of the Rings trilogy took digital effects to new heights making creatures we all know don’t exist, look real. The sharp detail and fluid 3D aspects work well, but the entire film looks like a made for T.V. movie rendered into a video game cinematic instead of a stunning display of glorious eye candy. The visual disruption of The Hobbit is so distracting it was hard to focus on the dialogue of the film’s two openings.



The fear has set in that Peter Jackson may fall into the George Lucas trap.  Jackson is a far better director than Lucas ever was, but like the original Star Wars films, The Lord of the Rings trilogy was a milestone in cinematic history that marked an evolution in digital effects and created a marker for younger generations to adore as the defining moment in film for their childhood. 



As the film pressed along and my eyes adjusted, things did progress a little. The entire second half of the film has some great little vignettes as the team of small warriors fall into the hands of the Goblin King and Bilbo runs into our old friend Gollum, which leads to him obtaining a certain ring. Even through the unnatural character movements of the HFR process, Gollum is more impressive than ever. With even more of actor Andy Serkis’ real face bleeding through the twisted creature’s digital features, the battle of wits between Bilbo and Gollum is playfully silly while resting on a layer of terrifying uneasiness.",0
46,SPC_Doc1_Moana-Daughter-Chief.docx,"Moana is the daughter of a chief and will someday inherit her father’s position, but she’s furious when Maui, a tattooed, muscle-bound demigod, calls her a princess. Moana (MWAH-nah) is not only part of a dynastic line but also a girl off on an adventure in the company of a cute animal sidekick (a dimwitted chicken named Heihei). So not just any princess, in other words: a Disney princess. She may be on a quest to save her island and restore ecological balance to the planet, but Moana (voiced by Auli’i Cravalho) is also upholding a brand.

It is, as these things go, a pretty good brand. The Disney princess tradition has held onto its charm as it has changed with the times, widening its cultural frame of reference and allowing its heroines to travel down paths other than the one leading straight to matrimony. Moana, bantering with Maui (Dwayne Johnson) like a rival sibling and borne on her journey by the spirits of the ocean and her grandmother (Rachel House), has no need of a prince.



In the Disney kingdom, the in-house influence of Pixar has reinvigorated the animation (though some of us may still pine for the classic, painterly Disney visual aesthetic), and the rejuvenation of American musical theater has provided a fresh pool of songwriting talent. “Moana,” directed by Ron Clements and John Musker from a screenplay by Jared Bush, includes a few infectious numbers by Lin-Manuel Miranda and a heart-tugging orchestral pop score by the Disney stalwart Mark Mancina. Buoyant songs by the Polynesian singer and composer Opetaia Foa’i (performed with his band Te Vaka) anchor the film’s cheery globalism in a specific South Pacific milieu.



The plot is similarly syncretic, a mélange of updated folklore, contemporary eco-spiritualism and tried-and-true Disney-Pixar formula. Heihei, who beats out an adorable pig for the job of cute animal sidekick on the voyage itself, is a lot like Becky, the addled loon in “Finding Dory.” And the first part of the story, in which Moana’s anxious, protective father tries to keep his daughter from venturing beyond the reef that encircles their island, is a ringing echo of “Finding Nemo.”

Once an ecological catastrophe (and her grandmother’s example) persuade Moana to defy her dad, she must overcome her own doubts (and Maui’s skepticism) and prove herself through a series of ordeals. Unlike “Frozen,” which spiked the formula with genuine surprise, “Moana” unfolds more or less as expected. Which is just fine, really. Archetypes are there for a reason: to provide reassurance and encouragement amid the squall and uncertainty of life.

There are some touching and amusing zigzags on the way to the film’s sweet and affirmative conclusion. Moana inhabits a bright world of water and sunshine, into which the filmmakers insert a handful of visual and musical showstoppers. 

The best of these is probably a glam-rock pastiche called “Shiny,” performed by Jemaine Clement in the guise of a greedy giant crab.",0
47,VP_Doc2_Blade-Runner-2049.docx,"Over 163 stylish minutes, “Blade Runner 2049” wrestles with nothing less than what it means to be human, serving as a beautiful thematic companion to Ridley Scott’s “Blade Runner,” a film that redefined a genre. It’s too soon to tell if the follow-up will have the influence and staying power of the groundbreaking original but it’s clear from the beginning that this no mere piece of nostalgic fan service. Unlike a lot of reboots or long-delayed sequels that merely remix the themes and characters of the beloved original to give viewers the hollow comfort of familiarity, Denis Villeneuve and his team are remarkably ambitious, using the topics raised by “Blade Runner” to continue the conversation instead of just repeating it to make a buck. To that end, they have made one of the most deeply philosophical and challenging sci-fi films of all time, a movie that never holds your hand as it spirals the viewer through its gorgeous funhouse of the human soul.

Until then, I’ll just give you the very basics, as beautiful as they are. Riding a wave of gorgeous visuals from the legendary Roger Deakins and a crack effects team, Villeneuve brings us to Los Angeles in 2049. It’s been decades since the action of the first film, but the replicant-destroying Blade Runner is still a profession, personified here by Ryan Gosling as an agent known as K. His duty now is to track down old replicants who have gone into hiding, living long past their originally-programmed lifespan. In the film’s opening, Officer K tracks down a replicant who is just trying to live a peaceful life as a farmer (a spectacled Dave Bautista, doing a great deal with a small role). What he finds there will start what is essentially a detective story, spurring K to solve a mystery about his own past, the history of replicants, the power of memory, and what it means to be a human being. Robin Wright, Jared Leto, and Harrison Ford co-star.

From the minute footage of “Blade Runner 2049” started to leak, it was clear that the director of “Prisoners” and “Arrival” had created a film with a confident, strong visual language. The Oscar talk for the always-an-Academy-bridesmaid Roger Deakins started with the first trailer. The film is undeniably gorgeous, the kind of work that could be appreciated with the volume turned all the way down. Not only are Deakins and Villeneuve great at the “futuristic” aspects of their vision, but they’ve made a film whose most striking imagery often relates to nature. When I think of “2049,” I think of waves crashing, snow falling, and, of course, rain pelting down—an iconic image from the first film that’s almost subverted here in the second half. And Villeneuve and Deakins are often playful within this visually striking world, capturing images that work thematically—I think of a “small” K against gigantic statues at a point when he’s questioning his place in the world or a moment with a hologram that comes off a billboard to remind him of what he’s lost in a fashion that’s ten stories tall—while never losing sight of the pure beauty of it all. It’s one of the most stunningly shot films of not just this year, but the last several. I can’t wait to just see it again, just to bask in its visuals without trying to follow its plot. And the sound design is so remarkable that it’s almost overwhelming—this is a film you don’t passively watch, you experience it.",0
48,VP_Doc1_Blade-Runner.docx,"The strangest thing about the future is that this is now the future we once foretold. Twenty years ago, we thought of ""now"" as ""the year 1982,"" and we wondered what life would be like. Little could we have guessed that there would be no world government, that the cars would look like boxes instead of rocket ships, and that there would still be rock 'n' roll on the radio.

""Blade Runner"" asks us to imagine its own future, in ""the year 2020."" The movie takes place in a Los Angeles that looks like a futuristic Tokyo, with gigantic billboards showing smiling Japanese girls drinking Coca-Cola. I would have predicted L.A. would be Hispanic, but never mind. It looks sensational.



The city is dominated by almost inconceivably huge skyscrapers that look like the Merchandise Mart, times ten. People get around in compact vehicles that fly, hover, climb and swoop. (In a lot of fictional futures, people seem to zip around the city in private aircraft; can you imaging the traffic problems?) At ground level, however, the L.A. of the future is an urban jungle.

The movie stars Harrison Ford as a cop who moves confidently through the city's mean streets. He is laconic, cynical, competent. He has a difficult assignment. A group of ""replicants,"" artificial people who seem amazingly human, have escaped from ""off-world,"" and are trying to inflict themselves on Earth.

Ford's job is to track them down and eliminate them. Anyone who has read this far can predict what happens next: He falls in love with one of the replicants. She may not be quite human, but, oh, you kid.

This basic story comes from a Philip K. Dick novel with the intriguing title, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" The book examined the differences between humans and thinking machines, and circled warily around the question of memory: Does it make an android's personal memories less valid if they are inspried by someone else's experiences -- especially if the android does not know that?

Ford says he originally signed on for ""Blade Runner"" because he found such questions intriguing. For director Ridley Scott, however the greater challenge seemed to be creating that future world. Scott is a master of production design, of imagining other worlds of the future (""Alien"") and the past (""The Duellists"").

He seems more concerned with creating his film worlds than populating them with plausible characters, and that's the trouble this time. ""Blade Runner"" is a stunningly interesting visual achievement, but a failure as a story.

The special effects were supervised by Douglas Trumbull, whose credits include ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Silent Running,"" and who is about as good as anyone in the world at using miniatures, animation, drawings, optical effects and other ways of tricking the eye.

The visual environments he creates for this film are wonderful to behold, and there's a sense of detail, too; we don't just get the skyways and the monolithic skyscrapers and the sky-taxis, we also get notions about how restaurants, clothes and home furnishing will look in 2020 (not too different). ""Blade Runner"" is worth attending just to witness this artistry.",0
49,LAR_Doc2_Lord_Ring_Return.docx,"A “King” that earns its crown, Peter Jackson’s final installment in his monumental “The Lord of the Rings” represents that filmmaking rarity — a third part of a trilogy that is decisively the best of the lot. With epic conflict, staggering battles, striking landscapes, and effects, and resolved character arcs all leading to a dramatic conclusion to more than nine hours of masterful storytelling, “The Return of the King” is urgently paced without an ounce of fat. 



Unlike other trilogy finales, this one will rank with its predecessors at the box office.  In “The Godfather,” and “Star Wars”, the second film was by consensus the best and most adventurous.



What Jackson and New Line so boldly did right was to shoot all three in one continuous stretch rather than start from scratch each time.



Of all the wonders associated with these films — the well-structured overall script, the perfection of the New Zealand locations, the visionary scenic designs, the exceptional visual effects, the costumes, hair and armor, and the excellent cast — perhaps the most impressive feat of all has been Jackson’s ability to keep it all in his head through the years and deliver a cohesive work with a proper sense of balance and proportion.



Unlike his predecessors in the trilogy business, of course, Jackson had a ready-made three-part text to work from, one constructed to pay off in the climactic installment.



“The days are growing darker,” Frodo observes, as he and Sam continue to be guided by the fretful Gollum (Serkis), whose intended treachery is superbly revealed in a schizophrenic soliloquy delivered to his reflection in the water. 



All the representatives of Middle-earth will have to come together for humanity to have a chance.  To this end, King Theoden of Rohan (Hill) summons all the men he can to march to Minas Tirith, joined by warriors Aragorn (Mortensen), Legolas (Bloom) and Gimli (Rhys-Davies), and followed eventually by his feisty niece Eowyn (Otto) and Pippin’s friend Merry (Monaghan). In Rivendell, Elf Arwen (Tyler), refuses immortality to remain alive for the sake of her great love, Aragorn.



The emotional momentum surges along with the physical action. After early ambivalence over his responsibility for the Ring, Frodo grows into the job; after long dodging his royal inheritance, Aragorn finally rises to the occasion; Sam emerges as a three-dimensional character of intense devotion to Frodo even after he has been tricked by Gollum and exiled by his closest friend.



The building sense of dread is palpable. Frodo’s arrival at the bowels of Mount Doom is charged not only with physical but a spiritual agony that triggers hesitation of nearly fateful consequences.  The siege of Minas Tirith may well be the mother of all cinematic battles.



Jackson pulled off one of the most ambitious and phenomenally successful dream projects of all time, a complete visual rendering of a 1,000-page literary classic beloved by countless readers internationally, a set of films that satisfies the Tolkien purists and will generate well upwards of $3 billion.",0
50,LAR_Doc1_Lord_Ring_Fellowship.docx,"The Fellowship of the Ring, Episode One in Peter Jackson’s three-part screen version of the massive tome that is J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, really gets those pages dancing. Fellowship is the real deal, a movie epic that pops your eyes out, piles on thrills and fun, and yet stays intimately attuned to character. Even when the film hits bumpy patches, it never flies off the rails. After the close of a year of botch jobs — The Mummy Returns, Jurassic Park III, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider — Jackson is the wizard who gets it right.



Jackson pulls off a directing coup that should give George Lucas pause. It’s an amazing achievement, with a script that never allows computer-generated marvels to overwhelm the personal story. Jackson is the ringmaster of the year’s wildest spectacle.



As for the plot, no way can 1,000-plus pages of Tolkien be distilled succinctly. A ring with the power to destroy the world has passed from the dark lord Sauron to Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood). Frodo is a hobbit, a munchkin-short, sweet-natured, furry-footed species with a love of peace and of smoking pipe weed. Gandalf the good wizard (Ian McKellen) tells Frodo it’s his mission to travel east to Mordor to dump that ring into Mount Doom. Frodo takes along three fellow hobbits, Sam (Sean Astin), Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan); two human warriors, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean); the archer elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom); and the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies). Counting Gandalf, who’s having his own problems with the corrupted wizard Saruman (the great Christopher Lee in fine horror fettle), that’s nine in the fellowship. The good nine are being chased by nine Ringwraiths, dark riders on dark horses.



Female characters are underdeveloped. As Arwen, the elf princess, Liv Tyler sounds cute speaking Elfish, but she fails to give her role a pulse. Despite the lushness of Lesnie’s cinematography and the shimmering beauty of d Shore’s music, the love story falls flat. It’s a shock that the reliably excellent Cate Blanchett lacks magic as the elf queen Galadriel; sadly, all the scenes in the elf land of Rivendell have that over lit theme-park tackiness.



All is well again when the characters test their moral mettle against the power of the ring. Frodo develops in maturity as the story progresses, and Wood plays the role with soulful conviction. Mortensen, in the film’s best performance, brings heroic stature to Aragorn, befitting a man descended from kings. Aragorn’s conflict with Boromir, given haunting complexity by Bean, strikes at the essence of brotherhood and roots the film in emotion.



It’s emotion that makes Fellowship stick hard in the memory. Jackson wisely ends the film not with fireworks but with a small scene that cements the friendship between Frodo and Sam, a character of growing importance that Astin portrays with just the right notes of fun and feeling. Jackson deserves to revel in his success. He’s made a three-hour film that leaves you wanting more.",0
51,JKS_Doc1_The-Lord-of.docx,"'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King': THR's 2003 Review



The Return of the King. The sequel went on to win 11 Oscars at the 76th Academy Awards, including best picture and director. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below. 



An epic success and a history-making production that finishes with a masterfully entertaining final installment, New Line Cinema's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is a soaring legend in its own day and destined to be cherished for many ages to come. The Return of the King is the longest and most complicated of the three Rings films and probably fated to be the biggest moneymaker. Sure to be an Oscar contender in many categories and a breathtaking argument for director Peter Jackson winning every award there is to give, King has none of the usual deficiencies that frequently scuttle third films.



Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin), guided by the vengeful Gollum (again a wondrous combination of special effects and Serkis' inspired performance), finally enter Mordor, but the divisive influence of the Ring almost ends the fellowship of the two heroic Hobbits. When the three infiltrators pass by Minas Morgul (the dead city where the Nazgul reside), they watch another army of Sauron march to battle under the command of the Witch-king.



Eventually, this Black Captain of the Nazgul, who rides one of the dragonlike beasts first seen in Towers, has a fight with Eowyn and Merry in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, outside the walls of Minas Tirith, that readers have been waiting decades to see. It's a gloriously crowd-pleasing moment, while overall the lengthy siege is tremendously exciting and visually unparalleled.



Huge elephan-tlike Mumakil and trolls pushing the giant battering ram known as Grond join hordes of Orcs in a gargantuan assault on Minas Tirith, a fight which faithless Denethor turns away from when he gives into fear and fatherly pride by sending Faramir to certain death. It's the leadership-tested Gandalf who commands the defense of the city. Although Denethor comes off too as enigmatic compared to the original material, he sure has a spectacular final scene.



Jackson and co-writers Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh make noteworthy departures from Tolkien, including such crucial moments as what happens when Frodo is finally standing on a ledge over the Crack of Doom inside the volcano where the ring must be destroyed, and how Aragorn makes use of the Army of the Dead that only he can command. 



There are only brief moments with the saga's Elvish beauties: Arwen refuses to abandon Aragorn. Galadriel makes a crucial connection with Frodo near the story's climax. Dwarf fighter Gimli provides much-appreciated humor with his sarcastic remarks. Fearless Elf bowman Legolas delivers the best battlefield action, while wise Elrond provides Aragorn with the restored sword that defeated Sauron long ago.



The thunderous conclusion to the story of the Ring that includes the end of Frodo's journey and the battle outside the Black Gate winds down to a sublime denouement, leaving only 20 minutes to wrap up when Tolkien took a hundred pages.",0
52,DLC_DOC2_Parasite_Gisaengchung_Film.docx,"Korean creature-feature maestro Bong Joon-ho returns to Cannes with a dark family farce where the only monsters are human.

South Korean auteur Bong Joon-ho launches a sustained attack on the lifestyles of the rich and shameless with his latest Cannes competition contender, Parasite. He ditches the metaphorical layers and adopts a register closer to social realism, albeit spiced with dark satire and noir-ish thriller elements. Whatever the horror-movie connotations of that double-edged title, the morally flawed monsters in Parasite are entirely human.

Parasite is cumbersomely plotted and heavy-handed in its social commentary.That said, this prickly contemporary drama still feels more coherent and tonally assured than Snowpiercer or Okja, and packs a timely punch that will resonate in our financially tough, politically polarized times. 

From the opening scene, Bong sets up a stark visual contrast between the unequal social castes at play here. Disheveled patriarch Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family are crammed into a sunken, cluttered, bug-infested basement apartment at the end of a shabby street on the wrong side of the tracks. Ki-taek, his wife Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam) are all penniless and unemployed, unable to even hold down a lowly shared job folding cardboard pizza boxes. Without bad luck, they would have no luck at all.

But fortune favors the bold, especially when the bold are armed with flexible ethics and sharp forgery skills. Following a tip from a well-connected pal, Ki-woo lands a sweet job as a private tutor for Da-hye, the high-schooler daughter of wealthy corporate CEO Mr. Park and his glamorously vacant wife Yeon-kyo. In contrast to Ki-taek’s family, the Parks live high above the city in an airy, spacious, pristine modernist mansion shielded by thick concrete walls. A quick-thinking opportunist, Ki-woo spots a chance of securing jobs for his entire clan with the Parks, playing on their snobbish aspirations like a virtuoso. The plan runs smoothly, even if it means callously displacing the family’s existing domestic staff.

Initially a little slow to set up its dynamic tension, Parasite peaks during its lively mid-section as a fast-paced, black-hearted, Coens-esque farce before climaxing with a chaotic orgy of vengeful violence. As ever, Bong’s bludgeoning attacks on economic injustice have more passion than nuance, while a superfluous coda about secret coded messages is a clumsy twist too far. A good 15 minutes of the pic’s generous two-hour-plus running time could be comfortably trimmed.

Nonetheless, Parasite is generally gripping and finely crafted, standing up well as Bong’s most mature state-of-the-nation statement since Memories of Murder in 2003. The performances are uniformly solid, with special credit due to the child and teen actors. Hong Kyung-pyo’s high-gloss cinematography combines lustrous candy-shop colors with kinetic precision, while Lee Ha-jun’s production design is typically superb, especially the elegantly minimalist Park family mansion, which serves as both deluxe fortress and sinister prison. Spliced into Jung Jaei-il’s dread-laden score, fragrant bouquets of classical music provide bustling comic counterpoint as well as wry commentary on the snooty cultural values being slowly eviscerated onscreen.",1
53,KWB_Doc1_Artemis-Fowl-Review.docx,"For starters, it’s no Harry Potter. But when Aretmis Fowl debuts on Disney + on June 12th, you’ll wonder why this fussed-over and broken film version of Irish author Eoin Colfer’s young-adult bestseller — about a 12-year-old criminal mastermind — had to be this dramatically inert and emotionally barren. Colfer once described his fantasy series of eight Artemis novels as “Die Hard with fairies.” If only. What’s on screen comes up short on excitement despite the presence of some heady talent at the helm.. Try as they might, their efforts never achieve liftoff for a production that’s been languishing in development hell since the dawn of the 21st century. Colin Farrell, who seems to enjoy letting out the natural Irish lilt in his voice. Too bad he disappears from the film and his son’s life so often, leaving Arty (as dad calls him) rattling around in the luxurious Fowl manor in the care of Domovoi Butler (Nonzo Anozie). Arty dresses in Men in Black suits and shades, but his purported evil genius is nowhere in evidence. This is not Colfer’s morally compromised tween villain, but a relatable lonely boy who is glimpsed early hopping on a surfboard before schoolto show why Ireland is indeed “the most magical place on earth.”Sadly, said magic is otherwise in short supply. As the film begins, we learn that Arty’s mother has died, and Dad is a person of interest in some of the biggest robberies of the last 10 years (the Rosetta Stone and the Book of Kells are missing). Artemis Sr. keeps a lot of secrets — wait until you see his basement — but he does find the time to teach his boy about leprechauns, banshees, sprites, goblins and the fairies who live underground. Blarney? The movie comes front-loaded with exposition to help those who never read all or any of the books. Most of the verbalizing emanates from Mulch Diggums (Josh Gad), a giant dwarf (?) being questioned throughout the film by MI6. It helps that the fairies are ruled by Commander Root, cheekily played by Dame Judi Dench with a shock of white hair and voice that sounds like she gargled with gravel. Or something like that. Shaw, a prototypical sweet kid, isn’t given a chance to portray the Arty of the books, who came off like a calculating Mini-me of Die Hard villain Hans Gruber. Luckily, the movie is purloined right out from under Shaw by the delightful McDonnell, who plays Holly like pixie with attitude, a Tinker Belle so eager to become a real soldier in the fairy army that she could bust.The Disney version of Artemis Fowl covers everything in a blanket of bland that suggests the dull juvenilia  rather than the vigorous battle between good and evil that marked the novels. Instead, worlds collide at an Italian wedding where an escaped goblin goes on a rampage. “Most humans are afraid of gluten,” says Mulch, noting that there’s no way they can handle a goblin. The best way to handle this relentlessly nice movie that deserved a touch of nasty, is to enjoy the few flashes of what have been before the sheer heaviness of the production stomps out all the fun.",0
54,JC_Doc2_Terminator-Judgement-Day.docx,"While ""The Terminator"" was a great horror film, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" is a great action film. While ""The Terminator"" was about the horror of an unstoppable harbinger of a technologically-advanced but soul-dead present, ""Terminator 2"" is, like so many action films before it, a paradoxically violent screed against violence. The film's reactionary politics are essentially dated, though there are several modern fanatics who embody the paranoiac impulses that compel self-styled freedom fighter Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) to fight against mental institutions, the police, and common sense to stop artificially-intelligent computer system Skynet from obliterating humanity in a nuclear war. 

But it's important to note that Sarah is not the heroine of ""Terminator 2"" as she was in ""The Terminator,"" but rather a supporting character who helps raise both estranged son John (Edward Furlong) and cyborg bodyguard/surrogate dad T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger). The T-101 is the main character in ""Terminator 2"" since he, as he boasts, is a ""learning machine,"" capable of progressive adaptation. This was the path to war in the era of George H.W. Bush bipartisanship: using one lethal system to combat a more threatening system. Robots don't kill people—people kill people. 

The T-101's burgeoning ersatz humanity makes Schwarzenegger a perfectly re-purposed tool. Director James Cameron had to convince the Austrian Oak to turn his humanoid baddie into a good guy, a jarring transition that was partly difficult for Schwarzenegger to stomach due to the prior failure of ""Conan the Destroyer,"" another sequel that was relatively lighter than its predecessor. But the T-101's role change works as well as it does because viewers—both then and now—don't necessarily expect Schwarzenegger's deadpan killing machine to be capable of serving as anybody's Jiminy Cricket-like moral compass. Still, that's exactly what the T-101 does when he re-unites John with Sarah, and learns from both characters first-hand the value of preserving human life.

The T-101's change from a villain to a hero also reflects the ambivalent optimism at the heart of ""Terminator 2."" Some cogs in the system can be retrained, but not all systems are benign. The psychiatric institution, represented by vainglorious Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen), is tellingly dismissed since it keeps singular iconoclasts like Sarah down, and convinces them that they must genuinely want to re-assimilate rather than just mimic a desire to change (in ""Terminator 2,"" bad machines are good mimics, but good people are bad mimics). The cops, represented by the confounded detectives who interrogate Sarah about her connection to the T-101 and the gas-mask-making SWAT team that tries to prevent the destruction of Skynet, are ineffectual, and hampered by a lack of emotional inspiration. 

But nuclear families, like the ones that surround well-meaning scientist Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) and good-natured survivalist Enrique Salceda (Castulo Guerra), are all positive since they represent a bright future that must be protected (hope must be preserved and defended instead of cultivated and maintained). So it makes sense that Sarah stops being a machine-like human, and starts acting like a human machine when she encounters Miles and Enrique.",0
55,OHU_Doc1_Sorry-To-Bother.docx,"Boots Riley’s “Sorry to Bother You” is an adrenalin-shot of a comedy and a fearless dissection of identity politics, corporate malevolence, and the American tendency to look the other way when confronted with horror. In this brilliant satire, people gather around their TVs every night to watch a show called “I Got the Sh*t Kicked Out of Me” and embrace a new lifestyle called WorryFree, which is very clearly corporate slavery advertised as something good for you. 

Don’t worry. “Sorry to Bother You” is no message-heavy, standard social commentary flick. It is a hysterical comedy, one of the funniest movies of the year. Just as in the music he created with The Coup, the message never gets in the way of the rhythm. Riley’s film wants, first and foremost, to entertain you, and it almost certainly will do that, especially if you’re willing to go with it on a funky journey, no matter where it takes you.

When he’s advised by a colleague (played by Danny Glover) to use his “white voice,” Cash starts to move up the corporate ladder quickly, eventually getting access to the golden elevator taken only by the “power callers.” They sell things people really shouldn’t be selling, and Cash is good at that too, drawing the attention of the maniacal Steve Lift (Armie Hammer) and the disgust of Detroit and his fellow co-workers, who have been struggling to unionize for worker’s rights.

There have been stories of men who sold their souls for success since people put pen to paper, but Riley loads his Faustian saga with enough social commentary to fill a dozen comedies. Every scene feels like it works on multiple registers. It’s much harder than it looks to make people laugh and think at the same time, and it’s that ingenious balance that makes Riley’s script for “Sorry to Bother You” so special. It never loses sight of its need to entertain along with the fact that it serves as a wake-up call for viewers to ask more questions about their priorities and those of people in power. It’s also cinematically striking, especially for a debut. From the fantastic costume design to the visual flights of fancy—such as when Cash and Detroit’s garage apartment literally transforms as Cash makes more money and a literal nod to Gondry in a corporate Claymation video—“Sorry to Bother You” has a confident visual language that so much comedy lacks. 



Great satires don’t hold back, and Riley turns most of his choices up to 11. That riskiness leads to a final act of insanity that will lose some people—both times I’ve seen the movie you could sense part of the theater tuning out as the movie takes a turn into sci-fi. For me, I love it when a filmmaker doesn’t pull back from the edge, but goes right over it. So while that part of the film may be weaker than what came before, I still respect the willingness to go there.",1
56,YG_Doc1_Frozen.docx,"Walt Disney Animation gives Hans Christian Andersen's story, ""The Snow Queen"", their own take by rather telling it as a traditional Disney princess movie, since it's probably too difficult for the original story to a have a faithful film adaptation. The film, like any of the genre's classics, is purely delightful and undeniably heartwarming. 

The major part of the story that has changed is it's now about a relationship of two sisters. It's an interesting choice for the plot, providing more themes to fit to the other. There is a sense that it might break some grounds to the usual form of the genre, though halfway through the film somewhat follows the same mold, which there's the typical fairy tale question about what true love really is, but eventually it manages to deliver something much clever in the end. Instead of fulfilling romantic dreams, it rather acknowledges how powerful real love can bring. It's sometimes a bit obvious, but that certain kind of heart feels quite sincere and it triumphs for it. Whatever else is left about the storytelling is it needs to work more on its pacing. It seems too quick, though animated movies have always been into faster pace, but this one palpably doesn't have enough time for breathing unless it importantly needed to. It's a very minor thing to complain about, but it's hard to avoid noticing it.

One thing that it never fails recapturing is definitely the traditional magic. All the things you loved are right here!: great characters, adventurous tone, and magnificent musical numbers.The film benefits by its cast: Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel are both admirable as Anna and Elsa, while the rest are also full of personality. What brings it to the table even more are the songs. There is a sense of Broadway indeed, blending it with its wondrous animation makes it more captivating. The most memorable among is the ""Let It Go"" scene that brings a lot of impact, it's easily the best of its musical set pieces, giving a grand scale of bombast and emotion. The rest of the plot are just comedy and action, but the film has a better core which made these parts the least of what we should talk about.

There's plenty of magic and heart to be found in Frozen, in spite of a slight mess through the storytelling. As an adaptation, it is able to be inventive, otherwise it's simply a lovely fairy tale movie that has the charm of the old Disney classics, but really, it's not in those heights yet. It's just a reminder that these movies can still wake up our inner child no matter what age we're in. I mean, why doubt quality?; rich setting, compelling characters, and all. Having these kinds of cinematic experience always feels like a rewarding treat. There are also remarkable songs that are worth listening within its visual splendor. And so, Frozen turns out to be as spectacular as we wanted to be.",0
57,MT_Doc2_New_Storm_Frozen2.docx,"It’s likely that we are all familiar with the Princesses of Arendelle, Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel). Well, it would be hard not to be after the massive hit Disney had on their hands with Frozen back in 2013 and now the highly anticipated sequel is out in theaters. Once again, the audience follows Anna and  Elsa alongside their compatriots Olaf (Josh Gad), Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and Sven as they try to uncover a mysterious force that has put Arendelle and all its residents in grave danger. 



With a call similar to a siren’s that only Elsa can hear, she and Anna set off on a journey to discover where the song might be coming from and how it could possibly be the key to unlocking the source of Elsa’s powers, and the truth about Arendelle’s past. With a new mystery set out before them, the quintet embark on a new adventure which includes meeting new allies such as Lieutenant Mattias (Sterling K. Brown), Honeymaren (Rachel Matthews), Ryder (Jason Ritter) and Yelana (Martha Plimpton).



Where the film really shines is its voice cast. What Bell, Menzel, Gad and Groff brought to their characters of Anna, Elsa, Olaf and Kristoff respectively in the last film is back, and dare I say they’re even better in Frozen II. What made the characters much beloved after the first film is still in-tact in the sequel. With new experiences to be had, it’s interesting to see where the characters find themselves. In conjunction with the returning cast we have newcomers Brown, Ritter, Matthews and Plimpton who all do an equally good job with their respective characters. While they do not have the same amount of screen time or lines as their counterparts, all four do great work and it’s a treat to watch their characters interact with Anna, Elsa, Olaf, Kristoff and Sven. 



In Frozen II, all of the characters have to weather new storms in a plethora of forms, most of which deal with various changes that are happening in their lives. All are seeking happiness and a way to save Arendelle, but they are all also trying to deal with personal happenings. Due to this, we see our characters in places we haven’t seen them before and the voice cast navigates these changes with ease. It truly makes for some of the film’s best moments and the way that change is explained as something to be embraced and not feared (even if it is a change we do not necessarily want), is very well done.



Directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, Frozen II delves deeper into the world of magic than was previously seen in the first film. The main plot of the film is one that’s intriguing as its likely that many have wondered about the source of Elsa’s ice powers, and this sequel strives to rectify this with answers for the audience. However, the storyline suffers from a few choppy moments and is not always totally cohesive, which ultimately affects the film’s pacing – making it seem longer than it truly is.",0
58,KV_Doc2_Anyone-who-cares.docx,"Anyone who cares about movies must surely have heard something about the plot. This is a movie that has inspired an annual convention and the Church of the Latter-Day Dude. Its star, Jeff Bridges, has become so identified with the starring role that when he won the 2010 Oscar for Best Actor, Twitterland mourned that his acceptance speech didn't begin with, ""The Dude Abides."" These words are so emblematic that they inspired a book title, The Dude Abides: The Gospel According to the Coen Brothers, by Cathleen Falsani. This is a serious book, though far from a dreary theological work.



The Dude is Jeff Lebowski, an unemployed layabout whose days are spent sipping White Russians and nights are spent at the bowling alley. There is always a little pot available. He has a leonine mane of chestnut hair, a shaggy goatee, and a wardrobe of Bermuda shorts, rummage sale shirts, bathrobes and flip-flop,. He went to Woodstock and never left. He lives in what may be the last crummy run-down low-rent structure in Malibu. Trust the Dude to find it.



In the film, Jeff Lebowski tells the millionaire's daughter (Julianne Moore) that in his youth he helped draft the Port Huron Statement that founded Students for a Democratic Society, and was a member of the Seattle Seven. In real life Jeff Dowd was indeed one of the Seattle Seven, and remains so militant that at Sundance 2009 he took a punch the jaw for insisting too fervently that a critic see ""Dirt,"" an ecological documentary Dowd believed was essential to the survival of the planet. True to his credo of nonviolence, the Dude did not punch back.



In ""The Big Lebowski,"" our hero has left politics far behind, and exists primarily to keep a buzz on, and bowl. He is never actually drunk in the movie, and always far from sober. His bowling partners are Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). Walter, even taller than the Dude, is a proud Vietnam veteran and the strategist of the three. He and the Dude never mention politics. Donny is their meek sidekick, always a step behind the big guys. 

Details of the plot need not concern us. It involves a mean-tempered millionaire in a wheelchair who is the Big Lebowski (the Dude becomes, by logic, the Little Lebowski). He broods before the fire in a vast paneled library, reminding me of no one so much as Major Amberson in ""The Magnificent Ambersons."" His trophy wife Bunny (Tara Reid) appears to have been kidnapped. This leads indirectly to the Dude being savagely beaten by hit men who mistake him for the Big Lebowski. Well, how many Jeff Lebowskis can there be in Malibu? One of them urinates on The Dude's rug, which he valued highly (""it pulled the room together""), and the whole movie can be loosely described as being about the Dude's attempts to get payback for his rug.



The film is all about Jeff Lebowski's equanimity in the face of vicissitudes. He is pounded, water-boarded, lied to and insulted. His rug is pissed on and his car set aflame. He is seduced by a woman who wants only his seed. He has a fortune dangled before his eyes, only to have it replaced by telephone books and used boxer shorts. To heal and keep himself whole he stirs himself another White Russian, has a toke, sits in a warm bath. Like the Buddha, he focuses on the big picture.",1
59,OS_Doc2_The-Lego-Movie.docx,"After successfully testing the computer-animated waters on the smaller screen with the likes of LEGO Star Wars and LEGO Ninjago, not to mention a series of hit video games, everybody’s favorite Danish interlocking brick system has finally been transformed into a big 3D animated feature—with wildly entertaining results.

Arriving at a time when feature animation was looking and feeling mighty anemic—essentially reconnecting the same dots until the next big thing comes along—The LEGO Movie shows ’em how it’s done.

It’s a non-stop blast from beginning to end, jam-packed with a wacky irreverence, dazzling state-of-the-art CGI (courtesy of Animal Logic) and a pitch-perfect voice cast headed by Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell.

Backed by an army of executive producers, the Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow presentation should translate beautifully into whatever corner of the earth it plays, with a laugh-and-you’ll-likely-miss-something potential for repeat viewings.

Not that there was ever much doubt about co-directors and writers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller being the right guys for the job, having previously surprised with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and 21 Jump Street, but their gift for inspired lunacy hits fresh, imaginative heights in the anything-goes LEGO universe.

Serving as the idealistic heart of the picture is Emmet (endearingly voiced by Pratt) a sweet but generic regular guy of a LEGO minifigure with a prodigiously empty mind, blissfully content to let instruction manuals be his guide.

And that’s just the way President Business (Ferrell) wants it. A control freak of a CEO with world domination on his mind, his obsessive disdain for creative expression has turned him into the maniacal Lord Business, whose bidding his carried out by the swivel-headed Bad Cop/Good Cop (Liam Neeson).

But Emmet’s non-descript life is about to find meaning in a construction excavation pit when he stumbles across the elusive Piece of Resistance and, in the process, is earmarked as The Special--the one prophesied to reunite the great Master Builders and remove Lord Business from power before he destroys their various worlds.

Joining Emmet on his reluctant quest is the sassy, butt-kicking Wyldstyle (Banks), whose rebellious streak is represented by the hot-pink and turquoise ones in her hair; and Vitruvius, a blind, hippy-dippy sage (a hilariously loose Morgan Freeman).

They’re soon joined by Wyldstyle’s bf, Batman (a terrifically self-absorbed Will Arnett), and the cringingly sweet Unikitty (Alison Brie) who presides over the no-rules Cloud Cuckoo Land, along with numerous special guests.

Not only do Master Builders Lord & Miller, who crafted the script from a story by Dan Hageman & Kevin Hageman (Hotel Transylvania) manage keep all those careening bricks in the air with crack comic precision, they sneak in an affecting third act reveal that’s absolutely in lockstep with the venerable brand’s creative spirit.

60,DB_Doc2_Jordan_Peele_s_Us.docx,"Us, as soon as you’ve shaken off the chills it leaves you with, will send you off on a Google mission. First, you’ll look up the full text of a particularly apocalyptic verse from Jeremiah. Next you’ll look up Hands Across America, the Reagan-era charity stunt in which about 5 million Americans linked hands across the country for 15 minutes to fight hunger and homelessness (the actual numbers are dubious, but they did get a killer Toto song out of it). An ad for Hands opens Us, playing on a tube TV in an ’80s-era entertainment console, flanked by VHSes of The Goonies, C.H.U.D., and The Right Stuff. The obvious and not-so-obvious reference points for Jordan Peele’s film frame a lost chapter of recent American history so surreal that it’s easy to feel as if it must have been a dream, something from a collectively hallucinated alternate timeline.

Ideas about a hidden or bifurcated America abound in Us. It’s a home-invasion thriller paired with a more vast and ambitious science fiction conceit. In that regard only it is comparable to Peele’s beloved breakout Get Out; the filmmaker has a great sense of how to counterpoint interpersonal drama with big phenomena. But it’s a messier film than Get Out, in that it never quite gets around to saying the things it’s trying to say. This is not entirely a bad thing; its messiness allows the film to spend more time working up inventive scares than conveying an all-caps complete-sentence message. But Us’s central visual conceit — a family of doppelgängers’ attempt to violently usurp their doubles — is such a rich one psychologically, and only fleetingly does Peele really dig into the dread of that unnatural horror. 

The film opens 33 years ago, with young Adelaide (Madison Curry) spending the evening at a boardwalk carnival with her parents. Her parents fight; she wanders off into a hall of mirrors fun house, where she is terrified to encounter a flesh-and-blood double of herself. Flash forward to the present day, with Adelaide happily married to good-natured goofball Gabe and the mother of two children and, all of them en route to their beach house. Gabe toodles around in his new (to him) motorboat, and they all hang out with their friends Josh and Kitty. But a return to the beach where she got lost as a child reveals that whatever Adelaide saw that dark and stormy night in 1986 traumatized her and changed her forever, and now in present day, as if sprung from her nightmares, a quartet of doppelgängers mirroring her family arrive in the driveway, there to take their place.

But like those VHS tapes on the shelf in the opening shot, Us feels like something meant to be watched over and over until the tape wears down, and we graft our own meaning and nightmares onto it. It, and its unnerving performances, are the perfect conduit for contemporary anxieties about foreign threats, dissociation between our online selves and our physical selves, the sense that all our actions have been preordained by some power outside ourselves.",1
61,AEJ_Doc1_Review_how_to.docx,"There are moments in the “How to Train Your Dragon” series so beautifully realized, so attuned to the joys of flight and to nuances of light and shadow, that it’s worth wondering why the movies themselves never quite achieve your full surrender.

Perhaps the highs feel so stirring, in part, because they are surrounded by so much conventional din and clatter. To reach those lovely, near-wordless scenes of intimate communion between the young Viking leader Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his black-scaled companion, Toothless, you have to endure a few inscrutably busy action scenes and an awful lot of strained, obnoxious banter among Hiccup’s many, many friends. Couldn’t at least one of them have been incinerated or taken a fatal tumble along the way? The “Dragon” movies may aspire to be a PG-rated “Game of Thrones,” but that’s no reason to eliminate life-and-death stakes from the equation.

“The Hidden World” opens, Hiccup and his people have perhaps taken their dream of long-term coexistence past the limits of what is reasonable. the world’s “first Viking-dragon utopia,” though no one is rude enough to call it an infestation. Berk has since become a target for new villains like Grimmel (Murray Abraham), a fearsome dragon slayer determined to kill Toothless, the last of a rare breed of alpha dragons called Night Furies.

The intensity of Grimmel’s determination sends Hiccup in search of a permanent new refuge for his fellow Berkians, humans and dragons alike.  The entire village sets out in search of “the hidden world,” a secret destination at the ends of the Earth where, as we see Stoick telling Hiccup in periodic flashbacks, all dragons first originated.

Hiccup faces a lot of pressure to marry his girlfriend, Astrid (America Ferrera), though not, of course, from the relentlessly tough-willed Astrid herself. As if to further reinforce the subliminal connection between him and his master, Toothless finds a love interest of his own, a Light Fury dragon whose sleek body is covered with ivory-white scales.

Tale of interspecies harmony is complicated by a bit of intra-species romance. While the intense photorealism of the scenery has only deepened.

The supporting players are more crudely rendered, on both sides. The other dragons, for the most part, feel like colorful filler, equipped with all manner of inventive design curlicues but little in the way of personality. 

Far less interesting company than dragons should be, still preferable to Hiccup and Astrid’s relentlessly wisecracking friends, who once again include Ruffnut (Kristen Wiig), Snotlout (Jonah Hill) and Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). One of them keeps making inappropriate hot-mom jokes about Hiccup’s warrior mother, Valka (Cate Blanchett), who regrettably does not unleash her inner Galadriel.

 “How to Train Your Dragon” movies is that they have brought flickers of wit, grace and beauty to a lavish corporate enterprise without sufficiently transforming it. An epic, multiyear character arc has to compete with noisy action scenes and mirthless stabs at humor.

62,JM_Doc1_Big_Daddy.docx,"""Big Daddy"" is a film about a seriously disturbed slacker who adopts a 5-year-old and tutors him in cynicism, cruel practical jokes and antisocial behavior. Adam Sandler stars as Sonny Koufax, a layabout who wins $200,000 in a lawsuit after a cab runs over his foot, and now hangs around the Manhattan loft that he shares with his roommate, a lawyer played by Jon Stewart. 



Little Julian (played by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse) is dropped at the door. He is allegedly the roommate's love child. Sonny tries to turn the kid over to social services, but they're closed for Columbus Day, and so he ends up taking Julian to Central Park for his favorite pastime, which is throwing tree branches in the paths of speeding inline skaters. One middle-aged blader hits a branch, takes a nasty fall and ends up in the lagoon. What fun.

The predictable story has Sonny and Julian bonding. This is not as easy as it sounds, since any Adam Sandler character is self-obsessed to such a degree that his conversations sound like interior monologues. It is supposed to be funny that Sonny has a pathological hostility against society; when McDonald's won't serve them breakfast, he throws another customer's fries on the floor, and when a restaurant won't let the kid use the restroom, he and the kid pee on the restaurant's side door

The movie is filled to the limit with all the raunchy words allowed by the PG-13 rating. There's a crisis when a social worker (Josh Mostel) turns up, and Sonny impersonates his roommate and claims to be the kid's dad. We're supposed to think it would be nice if Sonny could win custody of little Julian. I think it would be a tragedy. If the kid turns out like Sonny, he's probably looking at prison time or heavy-duty community service. Sonny is the first couch potato I've seen with road rage.

The most entertaining supporting role is Layla (Joey Lauren Adams), whose sister is engaged to Sonny's roommate. Adams brings a certain sanity to the plot, although I don't know what a smart girl like Layla would see in this closed-off, angry creep. Even when Sonny tries to be nice, you can see the passive aggression peeking around his smile.

There have been many, many movies using the story that ""Big Daddy"" recycles. Chaplin's ""The Kid"" used Jackie Coogan as the urchin; ""Little Miss Marker"" (versions by Shirley Temple and Walter Matthau) was about an innocent tyke and a bookie; Jim Belushi's ""Curly Sue"" has some of the same elements. What they had in common were adults who might have made good parents. ""Big Daddy"" should be reported to the child welfare office.",1
63,MMC_DOC2_NewYorker_1917.docx,"The Beauty of Sam Mendes’s “1917” Comes at a Cost

By Richard Brody

The most vulgar visual effect that I saw in a movie last year wasn’t Marvel; it was in “1917,” and depicted the death of a soldier in combat. The soldier is stabbed, and, as he bleeds out, his face is leached of pinkness and turns papery white just before he expires. The character’s death would have been as wrenching for viewers if the soldier’s appearance remained unaltered and he merely fell limp. 

That tastefulness is a mark of the utter tastelessness of “1917,” a movie that’s filmed in a gimmicky way—as a simulacrum of a single long take (actually, it’s a bunch of takes that run up to nine minutes and are stitched together with digital effects to make them look continuous). Yet that visual trickery isn’t the fakest aspect of the movie. Rather, the so-called long take serves as a mask—a gross bit of earnest showmanship that both conceals and reflects the trickery and the cheap machinations of the script.

The story is a sort of “Saving Private Ryan” in reverse, and that reversal is by far the most interesting thing about “1917,” with its suggestion of an antiwar ethos. Somewhere behind the lines in France, a young British lance corporal, Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), dozing during downtime, is awakened by a sergeant and told, “Pick a man, bring your kit.” Blake chooses a fellow lance corporal, Will Schofield (George MacKay), a friend who’d been napping in the grass alongside him. The sergeant sends the duo on a special mission: to cross the former front lines, now abandoned by German forces, and take a letter to a colonel who’s with his troops at a new forward position. That colonel is about to launch an offensive against the apparently retreating Germans, but aerial reconnaissance shows that the Germans are luring the colonel’s two battalions into a trap. 

Blake is outgoing and earnest, Schofield is a sarcastic cynic, and the implication is that Blake has been chosen for this mission not because he’s necessarily the best soldier to undertake it but because he’s uniquely motivated to complete it—because he knows that, if he doesn’t reach the colonel in time, his brother will be among sixteen hundred soldiers who will be entrapped and massacred.

Instead, Mendes shuts down Blake and Schofield and envelops them in a silence of the mind in order not to probe or care what they think. What he substitutes for their inner lives are sequences that exist solely because they make for striking images. Its visual prose resembles a mass-market novel with the punctuation removed.

The film is dedicated, in the end credits, to Lance Corporal Alfred H. Mendes—the director’s grandfather—“who told us the stories.” In honoring the recollections and experiences of his grandfather, Mendes remains trapped in the narrow emotional range of filial piety that, far from sparking his imagination, inhibits it. His sense of duty yields an effortful and sanctimonious movie that, at the same time, takes its place in a lamentable recent trend. Mendes joins such directors of proud and bombastic craft as Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, Peter Jackson, and Damien Chazelle, who’ve recently made films that are fixated on the heroic deeds of earlier British and American generations.

“The Imitation Game” is a highly conventional movie about a profoundly unusual man. This is not entirely a bad thing. Alan Turing’s tragically shortened life — he was 41 when he died in 1954 — is a complex and fascinating story, bristling with ideas and present-day implications, and it benefits from the streamlined structure and accessible presentation of modern prestige cinema. The science is not too difficult, the emotions are clear and emphatic, and the truth of history is respected just enough to make room for tidy and engrossing drama.



An Alan Turing biopic is, all in all, a very welcome thing. Chances are that you are reading this, as I am writing it, on a device that came into being partly as a result of papers Turing published in the 1930s exploring the possibility of what he called a “universal machine.” His decisive contribution to the breaking of the Nazi Enigma code gave the Allied forces an intelligence advantage that helped defeat Germany, though the extent of his wartime role was kept secret for many years. The secret of his homosexuality was revealed when he was arrested on indecency charges in 1952, caught up in a Cold War climate of homophobia and political paranoia and subjected to the pseudoscientific cruelty of the British judicial system.



All of this is a lot for a single movie to take in, and “The Imitation Game,” directed by Morten Tyldum from a script by Graham Moore, prunes and compresses a narrative laid out most comprehensively in Andrew Hodges’s scrupulous and enthralling 1983 biography. The film interweaves three decisive periods in Turing’s life, using his interrogation by a Manchester detective (Rory Kinnear) as a framing device. Turing tells the investigator — who thinks he is after a Soviet spy rather than a gay man — about what he did during the war. Later, there are flashbacks to Turing’s school days, where he discovered the joys of cryptography and fell in love with a slightly older boy named Christopher Morcom.



The adult Turing is played by Benedict Cumberbatch (his younger self is Alex Lawther), expanding his repertoire of socially awkward intellectual prodigies, real and fictional. What has made Mr. Cumberbatch so effective as Sherlock Holmes and Julian Assange — and what makes his Alan Turing one of the year’s finest pieces of screen acting — is his curious ability to suggest cold detachment and acute sensitivity at the same time. If he did not exist, 21st-century popular culture would have to invent him: a sentient robot, an empathetic space alien, a warm-blooded salamander with crazy sex appeal.



His Turing, whom the film seems to place somewhere on the autism spectrum, is as socially awkward as he is intellectually agile. He can perceive patterns invisible to others but also finds himself stranded in the desert of the literal. Jokes fly over his head, sarcasm does not register, and when one of his colleagues says, “We’re going to get some lunch,” Turing hears a trivial statement of fact rather than a friendly invitation.



Key words: Turing, Enigma, Imitation, War, Code.",1
65,JA_Doc1_Imitation_Game_Review.docx,"Benedict Cumberbatch’s excellent performance gives added complexity to a fine account of the life of codebreaker Alan Turing.

 

“Are you paying attention?” breathes Benedict Cumberbatch’s Alan Turing in the opening moments of this handsomely engrossing and poignantly melancholic thriller from Norwegian director Morten Tyldum. There’s little chance of doing anything else as Tyldum, who directed the tonally divergent Headhunters, serves up rollicking code-cracking wartime thrills laced with an astringent cyanide streak – a tale of plucky British ingenuity underpinned by an acknowledgement that Turing, as Gordon Brown put it, “deserved so much better”.



Granted a posthumous royal pardon for his “gross indecency” conviction only last year, the mathematician and AI pioneer changed the course of the war only to suffer the indignities of arrest and “chemical castration”, dying in 1954 having apparently taken a bite from a poisoned apple.



Yet The Imitation Game is not a tragedy – rather, it is a celebration of Turing’s extraordinary achievements, a populist yarn that makes an admirably firm fist of establishing its spiky subject as a heroic outsider. As the mantra from Graham Moore’s catchy script puts it: “Sometimes it is the people whom no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.”



Reluctantly recruited by Commander Alastair Denniston (a witheringly supercilious Charles Dance) to join the country’s top minds at Bletchley Park in 1939, Cumberbatch’s appropriately indecipherable “odd duck” bumbles his way into Churchill’s confidence, securing funding to build a proto-computer (or “Bombe”) to crack the Germans’ daily changing Enigma code.



Meanwhile, plucky Cambridge maths grad Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) uses her crossword-solving skills to earn a place on Turing’s team and (unusually) in his affections. As the cogs of his Heath Robinsonesque creation whir, Turing struggles impotently to decode the signals of human interaction, the secret of his sexuality and the spectre of a lost childhood friend becoming talismanic ghosts in the machine.



Expanding upon the temporal shifts structure of Hugh Whitemore’s 1986 play Breaking the Code (adapted by the BBC in 1996, with Derek Jacobi reprising his starring role as Turing), Graham Moore’s dextrous screenplay skips between three distinct periods: Turing’s schooldays, wherein he tells close friend Christopher that people are like cryptographic puzzles; his time at Bletchley park, and the nail-biting adventures of the celebrated “Hut 8”; and the aftermath of the 1952 break-in at Turing’s Manchester home, which alerted the police to his homosexuality, with appalling consequences.



Historical liberties taken in the pursuit of drama range from the inevitable to the controversial (biographer Andrew Hodges, on whose book this is based, has complained that “they have built up the relationship with Joan”, suggesting a coyness about Turing’s true sexuality), with occasional false steps of all too convenient overstatement (placing the brother of a key code-breaker on board a doomed ship).



Yet for the most part, truth is sacrificed for the greater good of engaging cinema; Turing’s real-life “Bombe” may have been encased in a neat Bakelite box, but the audience needs to see its wires spreading out like entrails, mapping the complexities of its creator’s mind.
